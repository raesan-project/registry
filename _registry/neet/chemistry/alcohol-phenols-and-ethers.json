Additionally, the reaction produces phosphorous acid as a byproduct. This can be represented as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p>$$3 \\mathrm{ROH} + \\mathrm{PCl}_3 \\rightarrow 3 \\mathrm{RCl} + \\mathrm{H}_3\\mathrm{PO}_3$$</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here, $$\\mathrm{A}$$ is $$\\mathrm{H}_3\\mathrm{PO}_3$$ (phosphorous acid).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reaction with PCl<sub>5</sub>:</strong></p>\n\n<p>When an alcohol reacts with phosphorus pentachloride ($$\\mathrm{PCl}_5$$), it also replaces the hydroxyl group with a chloro group. The reaction differs slightly in the byproducts; phosphorus oxychloride ($$\\mathrm{POCl}_3$$) and hydrogen chloride ($$\\mathrm{HCl}$$) are produced:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p>$$\\mathrm{ROH} + \\mathrm{PCl}_5 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{RCl} + \\mathrm{HCl} + \\mathrm{POCl}_3$$</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here, $$\\mathrm{B}$$ is $$\\mathrm{POCl}_3$$ (phosphorus oxychloride).</p>\n\n<p>Thus, in the reactions provided:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>$$\\mathrm{A} = \\mathrm{H}_3\\mathrm{PO}_3$$</li>\n\n<li>$$\\mathrm{B} = \\mathrm{POCl}_3$$</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Matching these findings against the provided options, we see that Option D correctly identifies $$\\mathrm{A}$$ as $$\\mathrm{H}_3\\mathrm{PO}_3$$ and $$\\mathrm{B}$$ as $$\\mathrm{POCl}_3$$:</p>\n\n<p>Option D: $$\\mathrm{H}_3 \\mathrm{PO}_3$$ and $$\\mathrm{POCl}_3$$</p>\n\n<p>This is the correct answer.</p>"
