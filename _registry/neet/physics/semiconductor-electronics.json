      "explanation": "<p>When the output of an OR gate is applied as input to a NOT gate, the combination acts as a NOR gate. To understand why, let's examine the behavior of these logic gates.</p>\n\n<p>An OR gate outputs a logic high (1) when at least one of its inputs is high. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:</p>\n\n<p>$$ Y_{\\text{OR}} = A + B $$</p>\n\n<p>Where $ A $ and $ B $ are the inputs, and $ Y_{\\text{OR}} $ is the output of the OR gate.</p>\n\n<p>An OR gate followed by a NOT gate inverts this output. The NOT gate, also known as an inverter, changes a high input to a low output, and vice versa. So the output of the NOT gate can be expressed as:</p>\n\n<p>$$ Y_{\\text{NOT}} = \\overline{Y_{\\text{OR}}} = \\overline{(A + B)} $$</p>\n\n<p>This is exactly the logic operation performed by a NOR gate. Therefore, this combination of an OR gate followed by a NOT gate behaves as a NOR gate.</p>\n\n<p>So, the correct answer is Option B: NOR gate.</p>"
