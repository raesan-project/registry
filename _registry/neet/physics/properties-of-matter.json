Key inputs include the Young's modulus (E), coefficient of linear thermal expansion (α), change in temperature ($$\\Delta T$$), and the original dimensions of the bar.</p>\n\n<p>First, compute the linear expansion of the bar if it were free to expand. The change in length ($$\\Delta L$$) due to thermal expansion can be computed through the formula:</p>\n\n<p>$$ \\Delta L = \\alpha L_0 \\Delta T $$</p>\n\n<p>Given:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>$$ \\alpha = 10^{-5} { }^{\\circ} C^{-1} $$</li>\n\n<li>$$ L_0 = 1 \\text{ m} $$</li>\n\n<li>$$ \\Delta T = 100^{\\circ} C $$</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thus:</p>\n\n<p>$$ \\Delta L = 10^{-5} \\times 1 \\times 100 = 0.001 \\text{ m} $$</p>\n\n<p>This is the change in length that the bar would undergo if not constrained.</p>\n\n<p>However, in this scenario, the bar is constrained and does not actually expand. This constraint induces a compressive stress (constrained thermal stress) in the bar, which can be calculated using the formula relating stress, Young's modulus, and strain:</p>\n\n<p>$$ \\sigma = E \\epsilon $$</p>\n\n<p>Where the strain ($$\\epsilon$$) under constrained conditions due to thermal expansion is:</p>\n\n<p>$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{\\Delta L}{L_0} = \\frac{0.001}{1} = 0.001 $$</p>\n\n<p>Therefore:</p>\n\n<p>$$ \\sigma = 0.5 \\times 10^{11} \\times 0.001 = 5 \\times 10^7 \\mathrm{ N/m}^2 $$</p>\n\n<p>This stress is the force per unit area.
