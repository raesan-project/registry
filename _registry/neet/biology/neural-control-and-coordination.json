It contains several neurosecretory cells that produce hormones.</li>\n<li><strong>Medulla:</strong> The medulla oblongata, also part of the brainstem, primarily controls autonomic functions such as breathing, heart rate, and digestion (including gastric secretions).</li>\n<li><strong>Cerebellum:</strong> The cerebellum is located at the back of the brain and is responsible for controlling motor skills, balance, coordination, and posture.
