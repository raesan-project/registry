They are not present in all prokaryotes and are considered artifacts of chemical fixation used in electron microscopy. While they were once thought to be important for various cellular functions, they are now believed to be a result of the preparation process rather than a true cellular structure.</p>\n\n<p>Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option A: Membrane bound vesicular structure:</strong>  While mesosomes are membrane-bound, they are not vesicular structures. Vesicles are small, membrane-enclosed sacs that transport materials within the cell. Mesosomes are more like extensions or folds of the plasma membrane.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option B: Chain of many ribosomes attached to a single mRNA:</strong> This describes a <strong>polysome</strong> or <strong>polyribosome</strong>, which is a structure involved in protein synthesis.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option D: Medium sized chromosome:</strong>  Prokaryotes have a single, circular chromosome located in a region called the nucleoid. It's not a \"medium-sized\" chromosome in the same way eukaryotic cells have multiple, linear chromosomes.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, mesosomes are an artifact of chemical fixation and are not considered true cellular structures. They are formed by extensions of the plasma membrane in prokaryotic cells.</p>\n\n<p></p>"

It consists of a core of eight histone proteins (two each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) around which a segment of DNA is wrapped. This wrapping is what gives chromatin its \"beads-on-a-string\" appearance.</p></p>\n\n<p><strong>Euchromatin (C) - Loosely packed chromatin (I)</strong>\n\n<p>Euchromatin is a less condensed form of chromatin that is actively transcribed.

This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of tissues and organs. Imagine the lining of your stomach or intestines - tight junctions ensure that digestive juices and enzymes don't leak out and cause damage to surrounding tissues.</p>\n\n<p>Here's why the other options are incorrect:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option A: Adhering junctions facilitate the cells to communicate with each other.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This statement is incorrect. While adhering junctions do help in holding cells together, they are primarily involved in providing structural support and mechanical strength to tissues. Communication between cells is primarily facilitated by <strong>gap junctions</strong>, not adhering junctions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option C: Tight junctions help to perform cementing to keep neighbouring cells together.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This statement is partially correct, but incomplete. While tight junctions do play a role in holding cells together, their primary function is to form a barrier, preventing leaks.  <strong>Adhering junctions</strong> are more specifically responsible for cementing cells together. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Option D: Gap junctions help to create gaps between the cells and tissues.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This statement is completely incorrect. <strong>Gap junctions</strong> actually form channels between cells, allowing for the direct passage of ions, small molecules, and even electrical signals. These channels are essential for cell-to-cell communication and coordination in various tissues like heart muscle and smooth muscle.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, tight junctions act as barriers, adhering junctions provide structural support, and gap junctions enable communication between cells.</p>\n\n<p></p>"

The DNA in chloroplasts has a distinct structure and form.</p>\n\n<p>The DNA within chloroplasts is mostly:</p>\n\n<p>- <strong>Circular</strong>: The DNA forms a closed loop, similar to the DNA found in bacteria. This similarity supports the endosymbiotic theory, which proposes that chloroplasts originated as free-living prokaryotes that were engulfed by ancestral eukaryotic cells.</p>\n\n<p>- <strong>Double-stranded</strong>: Like most DNA, the DNA in chloroplasts is made up of two complementary strands that wind around each other to form a double helix.</p>\n\n<p>Based on this information, the correct answer to your query about the form of DNA present in chloroplasts is:</p>\n\n<p>Option B: Circular, double stranded</p>"
