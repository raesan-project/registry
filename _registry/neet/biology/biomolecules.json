      "explanation": "<p>The inhibition of the enzyme succinic dehydrogenase by malonate is a classic example of competitive inhibition. To understand why this is the case, let's explore the mechanism and dynamics of this specific type of inhibition in the context of the given enzyme and inhibitor.</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<strong>Competitive Inhibition:</strong> This type of enzyme inhibition occurs when an inhibitor compound resembles the substrate's structure and competes with the substrate for binding to the active site of the enzyme. If the inhibitor binds to the active site, it prevents the substrate from binding, temporarily blocking the enzyme’s activity. Importantly, competitive inhibition can typically be overcome by increasing the concentration of the substrate, as this can displace the inhibitor from the active site.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<strong>Succinic Dehydrogenase and Malonate:</strong> Succinic dehydrogenase is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the citric acid cycle, an essential metabolic pathway for energy production. It catalyzes the oxidation of succinate into fumarate. The structure of malonate is closely similar to that of succinate, the natural substrate of succinic dehydrogenase. Because of its structural similarity, malonate competes with succinate for the active site on succinic dehydrogenase. When malonate binds to the active site, it effectively inhibits the enzyme from catalyzing the reaction to convert succinate into fumarate.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<strong>Conclusion:</strong> Considering these points, Option C, Competitive inhibition, is correct for describing the inhibition of succinic dehydrogenase by malonate, as it directly competes with the substrate for the active site of the enzyme.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<p>Other options such as cofactor inhibition, feedback inhibition, and enzyme activation do not accurately describe the situation with malonate and succinic dehydrogenase. Cofactor inhibition involves inhibition by substances that affect the enzyme's cofactors, feedback inhibition generally pertains to the regulation of biochemical pathways by their product, and enzyme activation is a process that increases the enzyme's activity, none of which apply in this context.</p>\n\n</p>"

Thus, Lipase corresponds to <strong>Ester bond (II)</strong>.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Nuclease</strong>: Nucleases are enzymes that cleave the phosphodiester bonds within the nucleic acids, DNA and RNA. Therefore, Nuclease corresponds to <strong>Phosphodiester bond (IV)</strong>.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Protease</strong>: These enzymes hydrolyze proteins by breaking <strong>peptide bonds</strong> between amino acids. Thus, Protease matches with <strong>Peptide bond (I)</strong>.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Amylase</strong>: Amylase acts on starches, breaking down the <strong>glycosidic bonds</strong> in carbohydrate molecules to produce simple sugars. Hence, Amylase corresponds to <strong>Glycosidic bond (III)</strong>.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Matching these to the given options:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>A - Lipase corresponds to Ester bond (II).</li>\n\n<li>B - Nuclease corresponds to Phosphodiester bond (IV).</li>\n\n<li>C - Protease corresponds to Peptide bond (I).</li>\n\n<li>D - Amylase corresponds to Glycosidic bond (III).</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>This matches with <strong>Option C</strong>, hence the correct response is:</p>\n\n<p>Option C: A-II, B-IV, C-I, D-III.</p>"

The inhibition is thus due\nto substrate analogue. The enzyme, now cannot act\nupon the substrate and reaction products are not\nformed. E.g., the activity of succinate dehydrogenase\nis inhibited by malonate. K<sub>m</sub> value or Michaelis constant is defined as the substrate concentration at\nwhich half of the enzyme molecules are forming\nenzyme substrate (ES) complex or concentration of\nthe substrate when the velocity of the enzyme reaction\nis half the maximal possible. A smaller K<sub>m</sub> value\nindicates greater affinity of the enzyme for its\nsubstrate, hence, shows a quicker reaction. The\ncompetitive inhibitor decreases the affinity of enzyme\nfor substrate, thus increases the K<sub>m</sub> value.\n"
