They are prime examples of in-situ conservation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option B: Botanical garden</strong> - Botanical gardens are cultivated areas where plants are collected, grown, and displayed for scientific research, conservation, and public education. While they play a crucial role in plant conservation, they are not natural habitats and therefore don't fall under in-situ conservation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option C: Biosphere reserve</strong> - These are areas designated by UNESCO where humans and nature coexist sustainably. They encompass a range of ecosystems, promoting both conservation and sustainable use, making them a form of in-situ conservation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option D: National park</strong> - National parks are large areas of land protected for their natural beauty, wildlife, and ecosystems.

However, none of the choices directly mention these specific contributions. Among the options, the closest (though indirect) could be his theoretical work that touch upon aspects like species diversity estimations.</p>\n\n<p><b>Alexander von Humboldt</b>, known for his extensive work in biogeography, made critical observations on the geographic distributions of species. His work best correlates with the \"Species-Area relationship,\" which describes how the number of species increases with the area surveyed.</p>\n\n<p><b>Paul Ehrlich</b> is famous for his work on population studies and environmental issues facing humanity. His statement about the planet's carrying capacity and potential biodiversity loss is widely known. The \"Global species diversity at about 7 million\" might closely relate to his biodiversity and population studies, though it's not his primary known work.</p>\n\n<p><b>David Tilman</b> is well-acclaimed for his experimental work on biodiversity and ecosystem productivity. The \"Long term ecosystem experiment using outdoor plots\" directly correlates with his experimental approach to studying the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning using field experiments.</p>\n\n<p>Given these associations:\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>A (Robert May) might best fit with \"Global species diversity at about 7 million\" (III) though it's a rough fit.</li>\n\n<li>B (Alexander von Humboldt) correlating with \"Species-Area relationship\" (I) is a much clearer connection.</li>\n\n<li>C (Paul Ehrlich) and the \"Global species diversity at about 7 million\" (II) matches if we consider his general scope in biodiversity and population dynamics.</li>\n\n<li>D (David Tilman) with \"Long term ecosystem experiment using out door plots\" (II) is an exact match for his field of work.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Looking at the options provided,</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Option B: A-III, B-I, C-IV, D-II</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>This option aligns correctly as per the reasoning.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the correct answer is <strong>Option B</strong>.</p>"

It&#39;s often due to human activities such as deforestation, urban development, agriculture, and mining. Habitat loss can result in local or even global extinction of species.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Fragmentation : This happens when a large, continuous area of habitat is divided into smaller, isolated patches, often as a result of human activities like road construction or clear-cutting for agriculture. Fragmentation can isolate populations of species, preventing gene flow and causing a decline in biodiversity.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While climate change (Option B) can also contribute to biodiversity loss, it is not the only cause, and likewise for over-exploitation (Option C) and habitat loss and fragmentation (Option D) alone.

Of these, habitat loss and fragmentation is generally considered the most significant cause, as it directly affects the availability of the resources and space that organisms need to survive. It can be caused by a variety of human activities, including deforestation, urbanization, and agriculture. This loss of habitat leads to smaller, more isolated populations, which are more vulnerable to other threats and have a higher risk of extinction.</p>\n"

      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Wildlife refers to all living organisms\n(terrestrial, aquatic and aerial) living in all possible\nnatural habitats of their own, other than the\ncultivated plants and domesticated animals. Thus\n“wildlife” does not exist only in jungles and are\nhunted down but wild life includes even the\nmigrating birds, turtles, coral reefs, microorganisms,\ninsects, fishes, etc.<br><br>\nSeveral hundred organisms are endangered or on\nthe verge of extinction. The reasons are\ndeforestation, pollution, killing, over exploitation etc.\nThe most important among them is deforestation or\ndestruction of their natural habitat because it will\naffect the species (flora and fauna) of complete area\nand not only the few organisms. The natural habitat\nmay be destroyed by man for his settlements,\ngrazing grounds, agriculture, mining, industries,\ndam building etc. As a consequence of this, the\nspecies must adapt to the changes, move elsewhere\nor may succumb to predation, starvation or disease,\nand eventually dies.\n"
