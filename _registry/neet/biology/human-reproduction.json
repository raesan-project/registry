Milk is initially produced here and stored in the alveolar cells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Mammary tubule (E):</b> The mammary alveoli are connected to small ductules called mammary tubules, which transport the milk out of the alveoli.</p>\n\n<p><b>Mammary duct (A):</b> The mammary tubules merge to form larger ducts known as mammary ducts. These ducts conduct the milk toward the nipple area.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ampulla (D):</b> The mammary ducts widen into lactiferous sinuses, known as ampullae, which act as reservoirs for the milk before it is ejected.</p>\n\n<p><b>Lactiferous duct (B):</b> Finally, the milk travels through the lactiferous ducts, which open at the nipple for milk ejection.</p>\n\n<p>So, the correct sequence is:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\mathrm{C} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{E} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{A} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{D} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{B}$$</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the correct answer is:</p>\n\n<p><b>Option C</b></p>"

The primary components of the Fallopian tubes include the infundibulum, ampulla, and isthmus:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Infundibulum:</strong> This is the funnel-shaped end of the Fallopian tube nearest the ovary. Its edges are fringed with structures known as fimbriae, which help in capturing the egg released from the ovary.</li>\n\n<br/><li><strong>Ampulla:</strong> Representing the longest portion of the Fallopian tube, the ampulla forms about half of its length. It is typically where fertilization occurs when a sperm meets an egg.</li>\n\n<br/><li><strong>Isthmus:</strong> This is the narrower region of the tube that connects to the uterus.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>When examining the options provided, Option A mentions the \"Uterine fundus\".

The hymen is a thin, elastic membrane located at the entrance to the vagina. Contrary to common belief, the hymen is not an impermeable barrier that is always torn when virginity is lost via sexual intercourse. It can vary greatly in shape and size from person to person. Some girls are born without a hymen, some have small hymenal tissue, and others have hymens that are very elastic. Moreover, the hymen can be stretched or torn during a variety of non-sexual activities such as tampon use, physical exercise (e.g., biking, gymnastics), or medical examinations. Therefore, the state of the hymen is not a definite indicator of virginity, making statement I true.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Statement II: The hymen is torn during the first coitus only.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This statement is false. As previously mentioned, the hymen can be stretched or torn by activities that are not sexual in nature. Additionally, many women may not experience tearing of the hymen at all during their first sexual intercourse. In cases where the hymen is more elastic or resilient, it may not tear during sexual activity. Furthermore, there are practices and surgeries, such as hymenoplasty, that can restore or create a hymen-like structure, indicating that the hymen can be altered multiple times throughout a woman's life. Thus, the claim that the hymen is torn only during the first coitus is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the explanations provided:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option C</strong> (Statement I is true but Statement II is false) is the correct answer.</p>"

The signals for child\nbirth (parturition) originate from the fully developed\nfetus and placenta which induce mild uterine\ncontractions called fetal ejection reflex. This causes\nquick release of oxytocin from the maternal posterior\nlobe of pituitary gland which induces labour pains.\nProstoglandins, progesterone and estrogen also play\na role. Prolactin is the hormone which induces\nlactation and has no role in parturition.\n"
