Hemoglobin not only carries oxygen (O$$_2$$) but also plays a role in transporting CO$$_2$$ from the tissues back to the lungs.</p>\n\n<p>2. <strong>Reason R:</strong> This is also true. The binding of CO$$_2$$ to hemoglobin to form carbamino-haemoglobin is influenced by the partial pressures of CO$$_2$$ (pCO$$_2$$) and O$$_2$$ (pO$$_2$$). In tissues where cellular respiration is occurring, the pCO$$_2$$ is high, and the pO$$_2$$ is low. This environment favors the formation of carbamino-haemoglobin, as hemoglobin has a higher affinity for CO$$_2$$ under these conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, both Assertion A and Reason R are true. Additionally, Reason R correctly explains why Assertion A is true, as the conditions in the tissues (high pCO$$_2$$ and low pO$$_2$$) directly promote the formation of carbamino-haemoglobin.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Correct Answer: Option C</strong> - Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.</p>"

Understanding these factors will help in selecting the right option that describes the conditions favorable for maximizing the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin in the lungs.</p>\n\n<p>1. <strong>Oxygen Partial Pressure ($$\\mathrm{pO}_2$$)</strong>: High $$\\mathrm{pO}_2$$ enhances the formation of oxyhemoglobin. In the alveoli, where gas exchange occurs, the $$\\mathrm{pO}_2$$ is relatively high, making it a favorable condition for oxyhemoglobin formation as oxygen molecules bind readily to hemoglobin.</p>\n\n<p>2. <strong>Carbon Dioxide Partial Pressure ($$\\mathrm{pCO}_2$$)</strong>: Lower $$\\mathrm{pCO}_2$$ is favorable in the alveoli for oxyhemoglobin formation. High $$\\mathrm{pCO}_2$$ leads to a lower pH (due to formation of carbonic acid), which can cause the release of O<sub>2</sub> from hemoglobin (Bohr effect), reducing hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen.</p>\n\n<p>3. <strong>Hydrogen Ion Concentration ($$\\mathrm{H}^{+}$$)</strong>: Lesser $$\\mathrm{H}^{+}$$ concentration, or higher pH, increases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. In alkaline conditions (higher pH), hemoglobin is more likely to bind oxygen, thus forming oxyhemoglobin.</p>\n\n<p>4. <strong>Temperature</strong>: Temperature also affects oxygen binding. Lower temperatures generally enhance the uptake of oxygen by hemoglobin. However, since the lung environment maintains a stable temperature, significant fluctuations in temperature are less of a consideration in this context compared to $$\\mathrm{pO}_2$$, $$\\mathrm{pCO}_2$$, and $$\\mathrm{H}^{+}$$ concentration.</p>\n\n<p>Given these points, <strong>Option B</strong> - High $$\\mathrm{pO}_2$$ and Lesser $$\\mathrm{H}^{+}$$ concentration - best describes the conditions that are favorable for the formation of oxyhemoglobin in the alveoli. High $$\\mathrm{pO}_2$$ ensures that more oxygen molecules are available to bind with hemoglobin, and a lower $$\\mathrm{H}^{+}$$ concentration (higher pH) reduces the release of oxygen from hemoglobin, thereby increasing oxygen uptake.</p>"

In fish, water flows over the gills in one direction while blood flows in the opposite direction. This countercurrent flow mechanism maximizes oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide removal, making respiration more efficient.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option B:</strong> The residual air in lungs slightly decreases the efficiency of respiration in mammals.</p>\n\n<p>This statement is also correct. In mammals, some air always remains in the lungs after exhalation (residual volume). This air is less oxygenated compared to fresh air, which slightly decreases the overall efficiency of gas exchange in the lungs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option C:</strong> The presence of non-respiratory air sacs increases the efficiency of respiration in birds.</p>\n\n<p>This statement is correct as well. Birds have a unique respiratory system that includes air sacs in addition to lungs. These air sacs do not participate directly in gas exchange but help to ensure a continuous flow of air through the lungs, leading to highly efficient respiration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option D:</strong> In insects, circulating body fluids serve to distribute oxygen to tissues.</p>\n\n<p>This statement is incorrect. In insects, oxygen is distributed directly to tissues through a network of small tubes called tracheae. The tracheae deliver oxygen directly to the cells, and the circulatory system (haemolymph) does not play a significant role in oxygen transport.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the incorrect statement is <strong>Option D</strong>.</p>"

But to fulfill the oxygen\nrequirement of the body, blood has to carry\nmore oxygen to the body tissue and this is\ndone by the increased no. of RBCs."

The affinity of haemoglobin\nfor CO is 250 times its affinity for O<sub>2</sub>\n and COHb\nliberates CO very slowly and also due to that compound\nthe dissociation curve of the remaining HbO<sub>2</sub>\n shifts to\nthe left, decreasing the amount of O<sub>2</sub>\n released.\n"
