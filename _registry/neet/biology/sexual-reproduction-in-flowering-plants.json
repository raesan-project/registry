Nucellus:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>This is the central core of the ovule.</li>\n\n<li>It is composed of <strong>parenchyma cells</strong>, which are specialized cells that store nutrients.</li>\n\n<li>The nucellus provides nourishment to the developing embryo sac (female gametophyte) and ultimately the developing embryo.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>2. Integuments:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>These are protective layers that surround the nucellus.</li>\n\n<li>They develop into the seed coat (testa) after fertilization, protecting the seed.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>3. Placenta:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>This is a tissue within the ovary that connects the ovule to the ovary wall.</li>\n\n<li>It plays a crucial role in the transport of nutrients and water to the developing ovule.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>4. Funicle:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>This is the stalk that attaches the ovule to the placenta.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>In summary, the <strong>nucellus</strong> is the part of the ovule that specifically stores reserve food materials to support the development of the embryo within the seed.</p>\n\n<p></p>"

This substance is incredibly durable, resistant to degradation by chemicals, enzymes, and even extreme temperatures.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Function:</strong> The exine acts as a protective barrier for the pollen grain, shielding it from environmental damage and ensuring its survival during transport to the stigma of a flower.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Preservation:</strong> The exine's robust nature allows it to withstand the pressures of fossilization, making it a common element in the fossil record.\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Let's examine the other options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option A: Epidermal layer:</strong> While the epidermal layer of a plant does contribute to its structure, it's not the primary reason for pollen preservation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option B: Tapetum:</strong> The tapetum is a layer of cells within the anther that nourishes developing pollen grains. It doesn't directly contribute to the fossil record.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option D: Intine layer:</strong> The intine is the inner layer of the pollen grain, composed of cellulose and pectin. It's less resistant to decay than the exine and is less likely to be preserved as a fossil.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, the exine's unique composition and robust nature make it the crucial factor in the preservation of pollen grains as fossils.</p>\n\n<p></p>"

Vallisneria is an example of a water-pollinated (hydrophilous) plant. Unlike insect-pollinated flowers, which are often colorful and produce nectar to attract pollinators, water-pollinated flowers typically lack bright colors and nectar because they do not need to attract insects or other animals. Vallisneria flowers are small and inconspicuous.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Statement B:</strong> \"The flowers of water lily are not pollinated by water.\"</p>\n\n<p>This statement is correct. Water lilies are typically pollinated by insects, not by water. The large and colorful flowers of water lilies are adapted to attract insect pollinators, contrasting starkly with the typical features of water-pollinated flowers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Statement C:</strong> \"In most of water-pollinated species, the pollen grains are protected from wetting.\"</p>\n\n<p>This statement is correct. In water-pollinated plants, the pollen grains often have a covering or are structured in a way that prevents them from becoming waterlogged and sinking. This adaptation allows them to float on the water's surface and reach the female parts of other plants.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Statement D:</strong> \"Pollen grains of some hydrophytes are long and ribbon like.\"</p>\n\n<p>This statement is correct. In some water-pollinated plants, such as seagrasses (e.g., Zostera), the pollen grains are indeed elongated and ribbon-like, which helps them to be transported more effectively by water currents.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Statement E:</strong> \"In some hydrophytes, the pollen grains are carried passively inside water.\"</p>\n\n<p>This statement is also correct. Many hydrophytes have pollen grains that are transported by water currents, rather than being actively carried by animal pollinators or the wind. This passive transport is typical in water-pollinated species.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the analysis, Statements B, C, D, and E are correct, while Statement A is incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option D: B, C, D, and E only</strong></p>"

They are diploid and\nconnected by plasmodesmata. The microspore,\nmother cells consists of a callose wall inner to the\ncell wall. The mother cell then undergoes meiosis and forms tetrads of microspores. Finally the wall\nof the mother cell degenerates and pollen grains\nare separated."

      "explanation": "On the basis of number of megaspore\nnuclei taking part in development of female\ngametophyte or embryo sac, there are 3 types of\nembryo sacs–<br>\n(i) Monosporic type – In this type the single\nnucleus of functional megaspore undergoes 3\nmitotic divisions to form 8 nuclei, 7 cells.<br>\n(ii) Bisporic type – Here embryo sac develops from\n2 megaspore nuclei out of 4 nuclei formed after\nreduction division of MMC. It is also 8 nucleated.<br>\n(iii) Tetrasporic type – Here all the 4 megaspore\nnuclei formed after reduction division of megaspore\nmother cell are functional and take part in\ndevelopment of embryo sac. It is further of different\ntypes. Fritillaria type, Plumbago type and Adoxa\ntype are 8 nucleated.\n"
