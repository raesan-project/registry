      "explanation": "<p>The correct answer is <strong>Option C: Both Statement I and Statement II are correct.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here's why:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Statement I: Concentrated urine is formed due to the countercurrent mechanism in the nephron.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This statement is correct. The countercurrent mechanism in the nephron is crucial for forming concentrated urine. Here's how it works:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Loop of Henle:</strong> The loop of Henle, a part of the nephron, creates a concentration gradient in the medullary interstitium.  The descending limb of the loop is permeable to water but not to solutes.  As filtrate flows down this limb, water moves out due to the increasing solute concentration in the interstitium, making the filtrate more concentrated. The ascending limb is impermeable to water but permeable to solutes, actively pumping out solutes like sodium, potassium, and chloride ions. This contributes to the higher solute concentration in the interstitium.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Vasa Recta:</strong>  The vasa recta, the capillaries surrounding the loop of Henle, also participate in maintaining the concentration gradient. They have a countercurrent flow, meaning blood flows in the opposite direction of the filtrate in the loop of Henle.  This helps preserve the osmotic gradient by preventing rapid removal of solutes from the interstitium.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Collecting Duct:</strong>  As filtrate flows through the collecting duct, it encounters the concentrated medullary interstitium. Water moves out of the collecting duct, becoming more concentrated, ultimately leading to the production of concentrated urine.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Statement II: Countercurrent mechanism helps to maintain the osmotic gradient in the medullary interstitium.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This statement is also correct. The countercurrent mechanism is the primary mechanism responsible for establishing and maintaining the high osmotic gradient in the medullary interstitium.  This gradient is crucial for the reabsorption of water and for the excretion of concentrated urine.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, the countercurrent mechanism in the nephron is essential for producing concentrated urine and maintaining the osmotic gradient in the medullary interstitium.  Therefore, both statements are accurate.</p>\n\n<p></p>"

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "<p>The juxta medullary nephrons are one of the two types of nephrons found in the kidneys, specifically in mammals, including humans. These nephrons have distinctive characteristics and play crucial roles in the process of urine concentration, which is essential for water conservation and the regulation of blood pressure.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option A:</strong> Juxta medullary nephrons are located in the columns of Bertin.\n\n<br>\n\n<p>This option is incorrect. The juxta medullary nephrons are not located in the columns of Bertin. The columns of Bertin, or renal columns, are extensions of the renal cortex located between the renal pyramids. They consist primarily of lines of blood vessels and cortical material. The juxta medullary nephrons, however, have their renal corpuscles located at the deep cortex, close to the medulla, not within the columns of Bertin.</p></p>\n\n<p><strong>Option B:</strong> Renal corpuscle of juxta medullary nephron lies in the outer portion of the renal medulla.\n\n<br>\n\n<p>This option is incorrect. In juxta medullary nephrons, the renal corpuscles are not located in the outer portion of the renal medulla but are located deep in the renal cortex, close to the medulla. The renal corpuscles include the glomerulus and Bowman's capsule, which are essential for the filtration of blood.</p></p>\n\n<p><strong>Option C:</strong> Loop of Henle of juxta medullary nephron runs deep into the medulla.\n\n<br>\n\n<p>This option is correct. The defining characteristic of juxta medullary nephrons is the long loops of Henle that extend deep into the renal medulla. This structural feature is critical for establishing the conditions needed for the concentration of urine, as it allows for a significant reabsorption of water and solutes under the influence of various gradients.</p></p>\n\n<p><strong>Option D:</strong> Juxta medullary nephrons outnumber the cortical nephrons.\n\n<br>\n\n<p>This option is incorrect. Juxta medullary nephrons are much less numerous than cortical nephrons. Cortical nephrons make up the majority of nephrons in the kidneys and are primarily involved in the filtering of blood and initial urine formation under different conditions.</p></p>\n\n<p>In summary, the correct statement about juxta medullary nephrons from the provided options is <strong>Option C</strong>: Loop of Henle of juxta medullary nephron runs deep into the medulla.</p>"

This means that as the filtrate passes through this part of the loop, water cannot pass out of the tubule and back into the body, but electrolytes (like sodium and chloride ions) can be transported out, either actively (using energy) or passively (without using energy, following their concentration gradient).</p>\n<p>The Reason (R) states: &quot;Dilution of filtrate takes place due to efflux of electrolytes in the medullary fluid.&quot; This is also true. As the filtrate ascends the limb and electrolytes are transported out, the filtrate becomes more diluted.

Urea is produced in a\nseries of reactions (urea cycle) which take place in\nthe mitochondrial matrix and cytosol of liver cells.\n<br><br>\nUrea cycle (ornithine cycle) is the series of\nbiochemical reactions that converts ammonia, which\nis highly toxic and carbon dioxide to the much less\ntoxic urea during the excretion of metabolic nitrogen\nderived from the deamination of excess amino acids.\nThe urea is ultimately excreted in solution in urine."

      "explanation": "Concentration of urine depends upon the\nlength of Henle’s loop. Loop of Henle is the hairpin\nshaped section of a kidney tubule situated between\nthe proximal and distal tubules in the nephron. It\nconsists of a thin descending limb which is permeable\nto water and a thick ascending limb which is impermeable to water, complex movements of ions\nand water across the walls of the loop enable it to\nfunction as a countercurrent multiplier, resulting in\nthe production of concentrated urine in the collecting\nduct.\n"
