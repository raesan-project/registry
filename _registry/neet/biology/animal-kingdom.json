This means they have a body plan that can be divided into symmetrical halves along a single plane. Therefore, this match is correct.</p>\n\n<p><b>Option B: Sponges - Acoelomates</b></p>\n\n<p>Sponges are indeed acoelomates.

Radial symmetry means their body parts are arranged around a central axis. Thus, this match is correct.</p>\n\n<p><b>Option D: Platyhelminthes - Diploblastic organisation</b></p>\n\n<p>Platyhelminthes, commonly known as flatworms, actually exhibit triploblastic organisation, meaning their body structure arises from three primary germ layers: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Diploblastic organisms have only two germ layers: the ectoderm and endoderm.

They also have other key features like a dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail. </li>\n\n<li><strong>Vertebrates:</strong> This is a subphylum within the chordates.

This allows for the distinction of the internal organs from the body wall, and it facilitates greater complexity and organization of the internal structures.</p>\n\n<p><strong>B.

However, it's important to note that their larvae exhibit bilateral symmetry. Therefore, radial symmetry is found in adults of this phylum.\n\n<br/><br/>4.

The presence of pinnae (external ears): Most mammals have pinnae that help to collect and direct sound waves into the ear.\n\n<br/><br/>Option B is incorrect because indirect development is not a unique characteristic of mammals; many animals, including certain insects, amphibians, and fishes, undergo indirect development.\n\n<br/><br/>Option C is incorrect because a monocondylic skull, in which the skull only articulates with the first vertebra via a single condyle, is a characteristic of some reptiles and amphibians, not mammals.

The hypothalamus\nin the brain monitors blood temperature and controls\nthermoregulation by both nervous and hormonal\nmeans.

Here&#39;s a brief overview of the life cycle of <i>Fasciola hepatica</i> to explain why:</p>\n\n<p>\n1. <b>Miracidium:</b> The life cycle begins when eggs released into the environment from an infected primary host (typically a sheep or a cow) hatch into miracidia upon contact with water. The miracidium is equipped to infect the intermediate host, which is a specific type of freshwater snail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n2. <b>Redia &amp; Cercaria:</b> Inside the snail, the miracidium undergoes several developmental stages, initially transforming into sporocysts, then into rediae, and finally into cercariae. The redia stage is particularly noteworthy because within the snail, it will produce several generations, which increase the number of cercariae produced. The cercariae are then released from the snail into the water.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n3. <b>Metacercaria:</b> Once free-swimming, the cercariae encyst as metacercariae on aquatic vegetation or other surfaces. This encysted stage is infectious to the primary host. When the primary host ingests these metacercariae-laden plants or water, the life cycle progresses.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n4. <b>Adult:</b> Inside the primary host&#39;s intestines, the metacercariae excyst and migrate to the liver, where they mature into adult flukes, completing the cycle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTherefore, the miracidium phase targets the intermediate snail host, initiating internal development, while the metacercaria phase represents the stage at which <i>Fasciola hepatica</i> is capable of infecting the primary host, marking the transition from external to internal parasitism in the latter.\n</p>"
