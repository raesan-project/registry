Hence, it is often referred to as the \"emergency hormone\". Therefore, Epinephrine matches with \"Emergency hormone\".</p>\n\n<p><b>Thyroxine</b>: This is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland and is primarily responsible for regulating the basal metabolic rate (BMR). Therefore, Thyroxine matches with \"Basal metabolic rate\".</p>\n\n<p><b>Oxytocin</b>: A hormone best known for its role in childbirth and lactation, it leads to smooth muscle contraction, particularly in the uterus during labor. Therefore, Oxytocin matches with \"Smooth muscle contraction\".</p>\n\n<p><b>Glucagon</b>: This hormone plays an essential role in glucose metabolism, particularly in raising blood glucose levels, leading to hyperglycemia. Therefore, Glucagon matches with \"Hyperglycemia\".</p>\n\n<p>So, the correct matching is:</p>\n\n<p>(A) Epinephrine - (IV) Emergency hormone<br>\n\n<p>(B) Thyroxine - (III) Basal metabolic rate<br></p>\n\n<p>(C) Oxytocin - (II) Smooth muscle contraction<br></p>\n\n<p>(D) Glucagon - (I) Hyperglycemia</p></p>\n\n<p>The correct answer is:</p>\n\n<p><b>Option C</b><br>\n\n<p>A-IV, B-III, C-II, D-I</p></p>"

      "explanation": "<p>Steroid hormones are a class of hormones that are derived from cholesterol and are lipophilic (fat-soluble) in nature. They can easily pass through the cell membranes of target cells to bind with intracellular receptors. Common examples of steroid hormones include cortisol, testosterone, and progesterone, each involved in different regulatory functions in the body.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cortisol (Option A)</strong> is a glucocorticoid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex. It is involved in the regulation of metabolism, immune response, and stress response.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Testosterone (Option B)</strong> is an androgen hormone primarily produced in the testes in males and in smaller quantities in the ovaries in females. It plays a key role in developing male reproductive tissues and promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle and bone mass, and the growth of body hair.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Progesterone (Option C)</strong> is a hormone released by the ovaries and is important in the regulation of menstruation and maintaining the early stages of pregnancy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Glucagon (Option D)</strong> is fundamentally different from the aforementioned hormones. It is a peptide hormone, not a steroid hormone. Glucagon is produced by the alpha cells of the pancreas and works to raise the concentration of glucose in the bloodstream by promoting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in the liver. Unlike steroid hormones, glucagon does not pass through cell membranes but binds to receptors on the cell surface.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the correct answer to the question is <strong>Option D: Glucagon</strong>, as it is not a steroid hormone.</p>"

      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "<p>Statement Assertion A states that \"FSH acts upon ovarian follicles in female and Leydig cells in male.\" To analyze this, we need to examine the role of FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) in both genders.</p>\n\n<p>In females, FSH indeed acts on ovarian follicles. It stimulates the growth and maturation of these follicles, which is critical for oocyte development and estrogen production. Consequently, FSH plays a fundamental role in the menstrual cycle and fertility in females.</p>\n\n<p>In males, however, FSH acts on the Sertoli cells, not the Leydig cells. The function of FSH in males is to promote spermatogenesis by acting on Sertoli cells in the testes, which support the development of sperm. On the other hand, Leydig cells, influenced by Luteinizing Hormone (LH), are responsible for the production of testosterone, a primary male sex hormone.</p>\n\n<p>Moving on to Reason R, which asserts that \"Growing ovarian follicles secrete estrogen in female while interstitial cells secrete androgen in male human being.\" Both parts of this statement are accurate. In females, the growing ovarian follicles indeed secrete estrogen, pivotal in regulating the female reproductive cycle and secondary sexual characteristics. In males, interstitial cells, another term for Leydig cells, produce androgens, like testosterone, vital for male reproductive functions and characteristics.</p>\n\n<p>Given this, Assertion A is false because its statement about FSH acting on Leydig cells in males is incorrect. However, Reason R is true as it accurately describes hormone secretion by ovarian follicles and Leydig cells in females and males, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the correct answer is:</p>\n\n<p>Option D: A is false but R is true.</p>"

Instead, it interacts with membrane-bound receptors on the surface of the target cell. This is a common feature of peptide hormones, as they are too large and hydrophilic to pass through the cell membrane.</p>\n<p>Reason (R) is also correct. When FSH binds to its receptor, it triggers a cascade of intracellular events, including the production of second messengers like cyclic AMP (cAMP). The second messengers then go on to activate various biochemical and physiological responses within the target cell, such as cell growth and hormone production. This is a typical process for signal transduction initiated by the binding of a hormone to its cell surface receptor.</p>\n<p>However, (R) is not the correct explanation of (A) because it doesn&#39;t directly address why FSH doesn&#39;t enter the target cell. The reason FSH does not enter the target cell is that it is a peptide hormone, which cannot cross the cell membrane. Instead, it interacts with cell surface receptors to initiate a signaling cascade. The generation of second messengers, like cAMP, is a part of the signaling process that takes place after FSH binds to its receptor, but it is not the reason why FSH doesn&#39;t enter the cell.</p>\n"

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "<p>Erythropoietin is a hormone that plays a crucial role in the production of red blood cells (RBCs), also known as erythropoiesis. This hormone is primarily produced in response to hypoxia, which is a condition characterized by low oxygen levels in the blood. It functions by stimulating the bone marrow to increase the production of RBCs, thereby enhancing the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity.</p>\n\n<p>To address the specific options provided:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option A: Juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney</strong></p>\n<p>This is the correct answer. Juxtaglomerular cells, which are located in the kidneys, are primarily responsible for the production and secretion of erythropoietin. When the kidneys sense a decrease in oxygen levels in the blood, the juxtaglomerular cells respond by releasing erythropoietin, which then travels to the bone marrow to stimulate RBC production.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option B: Alpha cells of pancreas</strong></p>\n<p>This is incorrect. The alpha cells of the pancreas are responsible for producing the hormone glucagon, which plays a key role in blood glucose regulation by promoting the release of glucose from stored glycogen in the liver.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option C: The cells of rostral adenohypophysis</strong></p>\n<p>This is incorrect. The rostral adenohypophysis refers to the anterior part of the pituitary gland, which secretes various hormones, but not erythropoietin. The anterior pituitary's hormones include growth hormone, prolactin, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), among others.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option D: The cells of bone marrow</strong></p>\n<p>This is incorrect. While the bone marrow is the site where RBCs are produced, it does not produce erythropoietin. Instead, it is the target of erythropoietin, which stimulates the bone marrow cells to proliferate and differentiate into red blood cells.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the correct answer is:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option A: Juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney</strong></p>"
