Unlike angiosperms (flowering plants), gymnosperms do not have flowers and their seeds are not enclosed in an ovary. Let's look at each of the options provided to determine which one is not found in gymnosperms:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option A: Sieve cells</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sieve cells are a type of cell found in the phloem tissue of vascular plants. Gymnosperms have sieve cells for their nutrient transport.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option B: Albuminous cells</strong></p>\n\n<p>Albuminous cells, also known as Strasburger cells, are associated with sieve cells in gymnosperms. These cells play a role similar to companion cells in angiosperms by assisting in the function of sieve cells.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option C: Tracheids</strong></p>\n\n<p>Tracheids are elongated cells in the xylem of vascular plants that serve in the transport of water and mineral salts. Gymnosperms rely on tracheids for their water conduction and structural support.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option D: Vessels</strong></p>\n\n<p>Vessels are tube-like structures in the xylem that are responsible for the efficient transport of water. They are characteristic of angiosperms. Gymnosperms primarily use tracheids for water transport rather than vessels.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the information above, the correct answer is:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option D: Vessels</strong></p>"

An example is <em>Selaginella</em>.</p>\n\n<p>3. <strong>Sphenopsida</strong>: This class includes plants that have jointed stems and small leaves usually arranged in whorls. An example is <em>Equisetum</em>, rather than <em>Adiantum</em>.</p>\n\n<p>4. <strong>Pteropsida</strong>: These are the most evolved among pteridophytes and include ferns with large leaves (megaphylls).

Both <em>Cedrus</em> (cedars), <em>Pinus</em> (pines), and <em>Sequoia</em> (redwoods) belong to the gymnosperms. Thus, the match is correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option B</strong>: Angiosperms : Wolffia, Eucalyptus, Sequoia</p>\n\n<p><strong>Explanation</strong>: Angiosperms are flowering plants.

While <em>Polytrichum</em> and <em>Sphagnum</em> are indeed bryophytes, <em>Polysiphonia</em> is a red algae (Rhodophyta) and not a bryophyte.

Asexual reproduction in these algae generally involves the release of biflagellate zoospores that swim away and eventually settle and grow into new individuals.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Statement B: Sexual reproduction is by oogamous method only.</strong> - This statement is partially true. While sexual reproduction in Phaeophyceae often is oogamous (involving a large non-motile egg and a smaller motile sperm), there are instances where isogamy (both gametes are motile and similar in size) occurs, though it is less common. Thus, the statement might be misleading as it implies that oogamy is the only method of sexual reproduction.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Statement C: Stored food is in the form of carbohydrates which is either mannitol or laminarin.</strong> - This statement is correct. In brown algae, the primary carbohydrates stored are mannitol and laminarin. These serve as crucial energy storage compounds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Statement D: The major pigments found are chlorophyll a, c and carotenoids and xanthophyll.</strong> - This statement is true. The brown algae have chlorophyll a, c, various carotenoids, and xanthophylls like fucoxanthin which give them their distinctive brown color.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Statement E: Vegetative cells have a cellulosic wall, usually covered on the outside by a gelatinous coating of algin.</strong> - This statement is true. Brown algae have cell walls made of cellulose and are often covered by a layer of alginates, which can form a gelatinous coating.

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Diversification in plant life appeared due to\nlong periods of evolutionary changes. Algae and\nbryophytes have thalloid plant body with no\ndifferentiation into root, stem and leaves. They had\nno vascular tissues but later in pteridophytes vascular\ntissues (xylem and phloem) developed and plant body\nbecame differentiated into root, stem and leaves. But\nthe vascular tissues lack vessels and companion cells\nand they reproduce by spores.<br><br> In gymnosperms seed\nhabit developed but the seeds are not enclosed inside\nfruit. In angiosperms vessels and companion cells are\npresent, flowers are present and seeds are enclosed\ninside fruits. Thus the path of evolution is from algae\nto bryophytes to pteridophytes to gymnosperms and\nfinally to angiosperm.\n"
