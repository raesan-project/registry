This typically results in the gain or loss of one or more chromosomes, not entire sets. Therefore, the definition provided in the statement is incorrect as it suggests a whole set of chromosomes, which is more aligned with polyploidy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Statement II: </strong>Failure of cytokinesis after anaphase stage of cell division results in the gain or loss of a chromosome is called polyploidy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Polyploidy</strong> is a condition in which an organism has more than two complete sets of chromosomes. This typically occurs due to the failure of cytokinesis, but it does not result in the gain or loss of a single chromosome, rather, it results in the addition of entire sets of chromosomes.</p>\n\n<p>Given the explanations above, the correct answer would be:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option D</strong>: Both Statement I and Statement II are false</p>"

      "explanation": "<p>The correct answer is <strong>Option D: Pachytene</strong>. Here's why:</p>\n\n<p>Meiosis is a cell division process that produces gametes (sperm and egg cells) with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes (pairs of chromosomes with the same genes) undergo a process called <strong>crossing over</strong>, which involves the exchange of genetic material.</p>\n\n<p>Let's break down the stages of prophase I of meiosis, where recombination occurs:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Leptotene:</strong> Chromosomes condense and become visible.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Zygotene:</strong> Homologous chromosomes begin to pair up, forming structures called <strong>synaptonemal complexes</strong>.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Pachytene:</strong>  This is where <strong>crossing over</strong> actually takes place. The synaptonemal complexes are fully formed, and the chromosomes are tightly paired.  The exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids occurs within these complexes.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Diplotene:</strong> The synaptonemal complexes begin to dissolve, and the chromosomes start to separate. However, they remain attached at points called <strong>chiasmata</strong>, which are the visible sites of crossing over.  Recombination is complete at this stage.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Diakinesis:</strong> The chromosomes condense further, and the chiasmata become more prominent. The nuclear envelope breaks down, and the spindle fibers start to form.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Therefore, recombination is completed by the end of <strong>Pachytene</strong>, where the exchange of genetic material is finished.  Although chiasmata are still visible in Diplotene, the actual recombination event is already completed in Pachytene.  </p>\n\n<p></p>"

While spindle fibers are essential during this phase for pulling apart the chromatids, their initial attachment to kinetochores occurs earlier.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Telophase:</strong> This is the final stage of mitosis, where the chromosomes reach the opposite poles of the cell, and the cell starts to re-form its nuclear membranes.

Instead, metaphase chromosomes consist of two sister chromatids held together by the centromere. The sister chromatids are identical copies of a single chromosome that have been replicated during the S phase of the cell cycle.</p>\n<p>Now, let&#39;s look at the other options, which are correct :</p>\n<p><b>Option A :</b> Chromosomes lie at the equator of the cell - During metaphase, the chromosomes align along the equatorial plane (also known as the metaphase plate) in the middle of the cell. This arrangement ensures that each daughter cell will receive an equal number of chromosomes during cell division.</p>\n<p><b>Option B :</b> Complete disintegration of the nuclear envelope takes place - In both mitosis and meiosis, the nuclear envelope breaks down during prophase and is completely disintegrated by the time the cell reaches metaphase. This allows the spindle fibers to attach to the chromosomes and facilitate their alignment at the equator.</p>\n<p><b>Option C :</b> Chromosomes are highly condensed - During metaphase, the chromosomes are at their highest level of condensation, which allows them to be more easily visualized under a microscope. This condensation also aids in the proper alignment and segregation of chromosomes during cell division.</p>\n"
