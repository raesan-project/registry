Cellular respiration involves the oxidation of organic molecules to break the carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds and release energy.</p></p>\n\n<p><strong>B. The entire cellular respiration takes place in Mitochondria.</strong><br>\n\n<p>This statement is incorrect. While the majority of cellular respiration (Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation) occurs in the mitochondria, glycolysis (the first step) takes place in the cytoplasm.</p></p>\n\n<p><strong>C. Fermentation takes place under anaerobic condition in germinating seeds.</strong><br>\n\n<p>This statement is correct. Fermentation is an anaerobic process that converts sugars to acids, gases, or alcohol, and it can occur in germinating seeds when oxygen is scarce.</p></p>\n\n<p><strong>D. The fate of pyruvate formed during glycolysis depends on the type of organism also.</strong><br>\n\n<p>This statement is correct. The fate of pyruvate can vary depending on the type of organism and the presence of oxygen. For example, in aerobic conditions, pyruvate enters the mitochondria for the Krebs cycle, whereas in anaerobic conditions, it can be converted to lactate or ethanol, depending on the organism.</p></p>\n\n<p><strong>E. Water is formed during respiration as a result of O$$_2$$ accepting electrons and getting reduced.</strong><br>\n\n<p>This statement is correct.

NAD+ is reduced to NADH in this process, indicating an oxidation reaction.</li>\n\n<br/><li><strong>Option B:</strong> Succinic acid $$\\rightarrow$$ Malic acid is not a direct step in the TCA cycle. Instead, succinic acid is first converted to fumarate by succinate dehydrogenase, involving the reduction of FAD to FADH2, then fumarate is hydrated to malate by fumarase. Both involve transformations but particularly the conversion of succinate to fumarate involves oxidation.</li>\n\n<br/><li><strong>Option C:</strong> Succinyl-CoA $$\\rightarrow$$ Succinic acid involves the conversion of Succinyl-CoA to Succinic acid catalyzed by succinyl-CoA synthetase. In this process, a high-energy thioester bond in Succinyl-CoA is broken to release a molecule of coenzyme A (CoA) and produce succinate. This step does not involve the transfer of electrons or the reduction of NAD+ or FAD; rather, it's coupled with the phosphorylation of GDP to GTP (or ADP to ATP in some organisms), which is a substrate-level phosphorylation.</li>\n\n<br/><li><strong>Option D:</strong> Isocitrate $$\\rightarrow \\alpha$$-ketoglutaric acid involves the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate into alpha-ketoglutarate.
