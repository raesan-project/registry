      "explanation": "<p>The correct answer is <strong>Option D: Vasopressin from Neurohypophysis</strong>. Here's why:</p>\n\n<p>Diuresis refers to increased urine production.  Let's break down how each option affects urine production:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option A: Renin from JG cells via switching off the osmoreceptors</strong></p>\n\n<p>Renin, released from the juxtaglomerular (JG) cells, is part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).  RAAS primarily affects blood pressure and volume by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Increasing sodium reabsorption:</strong> This leads to water retention, thus increasing blood volume. </li>\n\n<li><strong>Constricting blood vessels:</strong> This raises blood pressure.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>While RAAS can indirectly influence urine production, it doesn't directly prevent diuresis.  Also, osmoreceptors are stimulated by increased blood osmolarity, not switched off by renin.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option B: ANF from atria of the heart</strong></p>\n\n<p>Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a hormone released from the heart's atria in response to high blood pressure. ANF acts to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Decrease sodium reabsorption:</strong> This leads to increased urine output (diuresis) and lowers blood volume.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Dilate blood vessels:</strong> This lowers blood pressure.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Therefore, ANF actually promotes diuresis, not prevents it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option C: Aldosterone from adrenal medulla</strong></p>\n\n<p>Aldosterone is a hormone secreted by the adrenal cortex, not the medulla. Its primary function is to increase sodium reabsorption in the kidneys, leading to water retention and increased blood volume. This effect is opposite to diuresis.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option D: Vasopressin from Neurohypophysis</strong></p>\n\n<p>Vasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), is released from the posterior pituitary gland (neurohypophysis). Vasopressin plays a crucial role in regulating water balance by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Increasing water reabsorption in the kidneys:</strong> This leads to concentrated urine and decreased urine output, preventing diuresis.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Vasopressin's action is the direct opposite of diuresis, making it the most effective in preventing excessive urine production.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In summary:</strong> Vasopressin (ADH) is the primary hormone responsible for preventing diuresis by increasing water reabsorption in the kidneys.</p>\n\n<p></p>"

      "explanation": "<p>The correct answer is <strong>Option D: closure of the tricuspid and bicuspid valves</strong>. Here's why:</p>\n\n<p>The \"lub\" sound of the heartbeat, known as the <strong>first heart sound (S1)</strong>, is produced by the closure of the atrioventricular (AV) valves. These valves are the tricuspid valve (between the right atrium and right ventricle) and the bicuspid (mitral) valve (between the left atrium and left ventricle).</p>\n\n<p>Here's a breakdown of the heart sounds and the events causing them:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>S1 (Lub):</strong> Closure of the AV valves (tricuspid and bicuspid). This occurs at the beginning of ventricular contraction (systole) when the ventricles are pushing blood out.</li>\n\n<li><strong>S2 (Dub):</strong> Closure of the semilunar valves (pulmonary and aortic). This happens at the end of ventricular contraction when the ventricles are relaxing and filling with blood.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Option A: closure of the semilunar valves</strong>: This causes the \"dub\" sound, not the \"lub\" sound.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Option B: opening of tricuspid and bicuspid valves</strong>: This occurs during diastole (ventricular relaxation) and doesn't produce a significant heart sound.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Option C: opening of the semilunar valves</strong>: This happens at the beginning of ventricular contraction and is silent.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>In summary, the \"lub\" sound of the heart is generated by the closure of the tricuspid and bicuspid valves as the ventricles contract and push blood into the aorta and pulmonary arteries.</p>\n\n<p></p>"

It initiates the electrical impulse, causing the atria to contract.</li>\n\n<li><strong>AV node (Atrioventricular node)</strong>: Receives the impulse from the SA node and provides a slight delay, allowing the ventricles time to fill with blood before they contract.</li>\n\n<li><strong>AV bundle (Bundle of His)</strong>: Transfers the electrical impulse from the AV node to the bundle branches.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Bundle branches</strong>: Conducts the impulses through the interventricular septum.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Purkinje fibers</strong>: Distribute the electrical impulse throughout the ventricles, stimulating them to contract uniformly and powerfully.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The correct sequence for the pathway of an action potential through the heart follows a route designed to efficiently coordinate the heartbeat starting from the initiation of the action potential to the consequential contraction of the heart muscles.

Compatibility is determined by antigens on the red blood cells and antibodies in the plasma. Here's how the compatibility works:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Type A:</strong> Has A antigens on the red blood cells and anti-B antibodies in the plasma.</li>\n\n<br/><li><strong>Type B:</strong> Has B antigens on the red blood cells and anti-A antibodies in the plasma.</li>\n\n<br/><li><strong>Type AB:</strong> Has both A and B antigens on the red blood cells but does not have anti-A or anti-B antibodies in the plasma.

People with O blood are universal donors for ABO transfusions because they have no A or B antigens on their red blood cells.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Given the scenario where the recipient's blood type is unknown, the safest option for blood transfusion would be Type O blood. This is because Type O blood has no A or B antigens on the red blood cells, making it compatible with any recipient regardless of their ABO blood type. Thus, regardless of the recipient's unknown ABO blood group, a friend with Type O blood could donate without causing a harmful reaction due to ABO incompatibility.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the correct answer is:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option C: Type O</strong></p>"

The correct unit should be grams (g) and not milligrams (mg), as haemoglobin content in blood is measured in grams per deciliter (g/dL).

Here’s why:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Veins:</strong> When medicine is injected into the venous system (intravenously), it is quickly carried throughout the body by the bloodstream. The advantage of venous injection (IV injection) is the rapid onset of effects as the medicine is directly entered into the circulatory system, bypassing the need for absorption. This method also allows for precise control over the dosage and is used for substances that might be irritants or not effective if administered by other routes.</li>\n<li><strong>Arteries:</strong> Injecting a substance directly into an artery is far more dangerous and is rarely done outside of specialized medical procedures. The arterial system is under much higher pressure than the venous system, which increases the risk of complications, including arterial damage and the potential for creating embolisms that could cause strokes or other serious issues.</li>\n<li><strong>Muscles:</strong> Intramuscular injections are absorbed more slowly than intravenous injections because the blood flow to muscle tissues is less than to veins. This method is used for certain types of medication that need to be absorbed over a longer period. It's safer than arterial injection but slower in effect compared to venous injection.</li>\n<li><strong>Lymph Vessels:</strong> The lymphatic system is not designed for the fast distribution of substances throughout the body. It has a much slower flow than the circulatory system and is involved in managing the immune response and transporting waste and other materials out of the bodily tissues. Injection into the lymphatic system is not a common practice for administering medications for systemic effect.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In summary, intravenous injection (Option C) is the preferred route for the immediate and safest distribution of injectable substances throughout the body.</p>"

      "explanation": "<p>In the ABO blood group system, there are two main antigens (proteins on the surface of red blood cells) that are considered: antigen A and antigen B. An individual's blood type in this system is determined by the presence or absence of these antigens. Additionally, in the bloodstream, there will usually be antibodies against the antigens that the individual does not express. For example, someone with antigen A will typically have anti-B antibodies, and someone with antigen B will typically have anti-A antibodies. A person with neither antigen will have both types of antibodies, and a person with both antigens will have neither type of antibodies.</p>\n<p>If both antigens are present (antigen A and antigen B) on the surface of the red blood cells but no antibodies against them are found in the plasma, this signifies that the blood group of the individual is AB. This is because the presence of both antigens means the immune system does not need to produce antibodies against them since the body recognizes both antigens as self.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the correct answer is:</p>\n<p>Option C: AB</p>"

      "explanation": "<p>The correct answer is <strong>Option B</strong>: muscle fibres found only in the ventricle wall.</p>\n\n<p>Let's elaborate on the nature and function of the Bundle of His to clarify this answer. The Bundle of His, also known as the Atrioventricular Bundle (AV Bundle), is a crucial part of the electrical conduction system of the heart. It is not a network of nerve fibers but rather specialized muscle fibers.</p>\n\n<p>The heart's electrical conduction system is responsible for coordinating the heartbeat, ensuring that blood is pumped efficiently throughout the body. The sequence of the conduction system goes as follows: from the sinoatrial (SA) node, located in the right atrium, the electrical impulse travels to the atrioventricular (AV) node. From the AV node, the impulse passes down through the Bundle of His, which then divides into the right and left bundle branches that run along the sides of the ventricular septum.</p>\n\n<p>The Bundle of His is specifically located between the atria and the ventricles within the heart's septum—the wall dividing the right and left sides of the heart. Its role is critical for transmitting electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles, a process essential for maintaining a synchronized heartbeat. After the impulse moves through the Bundle of His, it travels down through the right and left bundle branches and into the Purkinje fibers, spreading throughout the ventricles and causing them to contract.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the Bundle of His is comprised of specialized cardiac muscle fibers, not nerve fibers, and is found specifically in the heart's ventricular walls, bridging the electrical conduction between the atria and the ventricles. This corrects the common misconception that it might be composed of nerve fibers or distributed throughout the entire heart, including the atrial walls.</p>"

Let's explore why that is the case by understanding the role of the SA node and the other options provided.</p>\n\n<p>The SA node, located in the right atrium of the heart, acts as the natural pacemaker of the heart. It generates electrical impulses that initiate each heartbeat, regulating heart rate. These impulses travel across the atria, causing them to contract and pump blood into the ventricles. This is why, when the natural pacemaker fails to function properly, an artificial pacemaker is often installed to mimic the function of the SA node, ensuring the heart maintains a proper rhythm.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let's briefly look at the other options:</p>\n\n<p><b>Option A: Atrioventricular Bundle</b> - Also known as the Bundle of His, this pathway transmits impulses from the atria to the ventricles. While it's crucial for the coordinated contraction of the ventricles, it is not the primary site for initiating the heart's rhythm.</p>\n\n<p><b>Option B: Purkinje System</b> - This network spreads throughout the ventricles and ensures efficient contraction of the ventricular muscle. It's essential for the final distribution of the electrical impulse but not the initiation of the heart rhythm.</p>\n\n<p><b>Option D: Atrioventricular Node</b> - Located at the junction of the atria and ventricles, the AV node delays the electrical impulse slightly before passing it to the ventricles. This delay allows the atria to finish contracting before the ventricles begin. While important for coordinating the timing of contractions, it is not the site where the heart's rhythm is generated.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, among the options provided, the sinoatrial node (Option C) is the most suitable site for grafting an artificial pacemaker, as it takes over the role of initiating and regulating the heart rhythm.</p>"

It is located in the right atrium of the heart. This specialized cluster of cells generates electrical impulses that spread throughout the heart, prompting it to beat and pump blood. After the SA node fires, the electrical impulse triggers the atria to contract, pushing blood into the ventricles. The impulse then travels to the AV node (atrioventricular node), which acts as a gatekeeper, slowing the electrical signal before it enters the ventricles. This delay ensures that the atria have fully contracted and emptied their blood into the ventricles before the ventricles contract. Following the AV node, the impulse travels through the bundle of His, down the bundle branches, and through the Purkinje fibers, causing the ventricles to contract and pump blood to the lungs and the rest of the body.</p>\n\n<p>The vagus nerve (Option C) and the cardiac nerves (Option D) are part of the autonomic nervous system, which regulates the speed and strength of heartbeats but does not originate the heartbeat.

The lumen size can vary based on the specific segment of the vessel and the volume of blood it is transporting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option B: Its wall is thick.</strong> This is true and distinguishes the pulmonary artery from the pulmonary vein. Typically, arteries have thicker walls than veins because they must withstand and convey the higher pressure of blood pumped from the heart. Even though the pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood to the lungs — and does so at a lower pressure than systemic arteries — its walls are still thicker than those of the pulmonary veins, which carry oxygenated blood back to the heart.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option C: It has valves.</strong> This option is not correct. Pulmonary arteries do not have valves. The confusion might arise from the fact that vein systems, including pulmonary veins, generally have valves to prevent backflow of blood. This characteristic is not found in the pulmonary artery.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option D: It does not possess endothelium.</strong> This is incorrect. All blood vessels, including the pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein, are lined with endothelium. The endothelium is a thin layer of cells that provides a barrier between the blood and the rest of the vessel wall, facilitating smooth blood flow and playing roles in vascular health and disease prevention.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the primary distinction between the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary vein, as highlighted by the options given, is the thickness of their walls (Option B).</p>"
