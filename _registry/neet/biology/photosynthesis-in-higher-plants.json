This phase requires several key components to occur, which include:</p>\n\n<p><b>Chlorophyll</b> (D): Chlorophyll is the pigment that absorbs light energy, which is crucial for the light reaction. When chlorophyll absorbs light, it becomes excited and this energy is used to convert $$\\mathrm{ADP}$$ and $$\\mathrm{P_i}$$ (inorganic phosphate) into $$\\mathrm{ATP}$$ and to reduce $$\\mathrm{NADP}^+$$ into $$\\mathrm{NADPH}$$.</p>\n\n<p><b>Light</b> (E): Light provides the energy necessary for the excitation of chlorophyll electrons. Without light, the light reactions cannot take place.</p>\n\n<p><b>$$\\mathrm{H}_2 \\mathrm{O}$$</b> (C): Water molecules are split during the light reaction in a process known as photolysis.

      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "<p>The Calvin cycle, also known as the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, is the set of chemical reactions that take place in chloroplasts during photosynthesis. The cycle is light-independent because it takes place after the energy has been captured from sunlight. The Calvin cycle uses ATP and NADPH as energy sources, and incorporates $$\\mathrm{CO}_2$$ into organic molecules, eventually producing glucose.</p>\n\n<p>The cycle consists of three main stages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Carbon fixation</li>\n<li>Reduction phase</li>\n<li>Regeneration of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the Calvin cycle:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Carbon Fixation:</strong> Each $$\\mathrm{CO}_2$$ molecule is attached to a five-carbon sugar named ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP). This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO). The product of this reaction is a six-carbon intermediate that immediately splits into two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA).</li>\n<li><strong>Reduction Phase:</strong> Each 3-PGA is phosphorylated by ATP (consuming 2 ATP molecules total for two 3-PGA molecules) to form 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. This molecule is then reduced by NADPH (using 2 NADPH molecules in total) to form glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). Out of every six G3P formed, one exits the cycle to contribute towards forming glucose, while the rest are recycled to regenerate RuBP.</li>\n<li><strong>Regeneration of RuBP:</strong> For every three CO<sub>2</sub> molecules fixed, five molecules of G3P are used to regenerate three molecules of RuBP, requiring further ATP input (3 more ATP molecules).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thus, for each incorporated $$\\mathrm{CO}_2$$ molecule, 3 ATP molecules and 2 NADPH molecules are required:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3 ATP molecules (2 for the reduction of two molecules of 3-PGA into 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and then one for the regeneration phase of RuBP).</li>\n<li>2 NADPH molecules are used to reduce two molecules of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to G3P.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Therefore, the correct answer to the question is Option D: 3 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of NADPH are required for every molecule of $$\\mathrm{CO}_2$$ fixed in the Calvin cycle.</p>"

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Photosynthesis is actually oxidation\nreduction process in which water is oxidised and CO<sub>2</sub>\nis reduced to carbohydrates. The reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to carbohydrates needs assimilatory powers, i.e., ATP\nand NADPH<sub>2</sub>. The process of photosynthesis involves\ntwo steps–<br>\n(i) Light dependent phase or photochemical\nreaction.<br>\n(ii) Light independent phase or dark reaction.<br>\nIn Calvin cycle, CO<sub>2</sub>\n acceptor molecule is RuBP or\nRuDP. The enzyme catalyzing this reaction is RuBPcarboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO). As Calvin cycle\ntakes in only one carbon (as CO<sub>2</sub>\n) at a time, so it takes\nsix turns of the cycle to produce a net gain of six\ncarbons (i.e., hexose or glucose). In this cycle, for\nformation of one mole of hexose sugar (Glucose), 18\nATP and 12 NADPH<sub>2</sub>\n are used. For 6 molecules of\nCO<sub>2</sub>\n it needs 18 ATP and 12 NADPH<sub>2</sub>\n molecules so\nfor assimilation of one molecule of CO<sub>2</sub>\n it needs 3 ATP\nand 2 NADPH<sub>2</sub>\n molecules.\n\n"
