Antibiotics are naturally occurring substances produced by certain microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. These substances have the ability to inhibit the growth or kill other microorganisms, particularly bacteria.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Statement II: Antibodies are chemicals formed in the body that eliminate microbes.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This statement is also correct. Antibodies are specialized proteins produced by the immune system in response to the presence of foreign substances, such as bacteria, viruses, and toxins. These antibodies bind to specific antigens (markers) on the surface of the microbes, marking them for destruction by other immune cells.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, both antibiotics and antibodies play critical roles in combating microbial infections, but they operate through different mechanisms. Antibiotics are produced by microbes and directly kill or inhibit the growth of other microbes, while antibodies are produced by the body's immune system and specifically target and neutralize microbes.</p>\n\n<p></p>"

      "explanation": "<p>(A) Cytokine barriers - (II) Interferons</p>\n<p>Cytokines are a broad and loose category of small proteins that are important in cell signaling. Their release has an effect on the behavior of cells around them. It can be due to immune response or inflammation. Interferons are a type of cytokine. They are released by host cells in response to the presence of pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, parasites, or tumor cells. They allow for communication between cells to trigger the protective defenses of the immune system that eradicate pathogens or tumors.</p>\n<p>(B) Cellular barriers - (III) Neutrophils and Macrophages</p>\n<p>Cellular barriers are formed by immune cells that prevent the spread and movement of foreign substances in the body. Neutrophils and macrophages are types of white blood cells and are part of the immune system. Neutrophils are the most abundant type of granulocytes and the most abundant type of white blood cells in most mammals. They form an essential part of the innate immune system. Their functions vary from the destruction of bacteria and fungi to the stimulation of other immune cells. Macrophages, on the other hand, are a type of white blood cell that engulfs and digests cellular debris, foreign substances, microbes, cancer cells, and anything else that does not have the type of proteins specific to healthy body cells on its surface in a process called phagocytosis.</p>\n<p>(C) Physiological barriers - (IV) Tears and Saliva</p>\n<p>Physiological barriers are those which use the body’s own natural processes to prevent infection. For instance, both tears and saliva contain enzymes such as lysozyme which help to break down the cell walls of many kinds of bacteria.</p>\n<p>(D) Physical barriers - (I) Mucus coating of the respiratory tract</p>\n<p>Physical barriers are the body&#39;s first line of defense against pathogens. These barriers are structural in nature. The mucus coating of the respiratory tract is a great example. It traps pathogens, dust, and other particles that enter the nasal passage with each breath, and because the mucus is constantly moved by cilia, it is eventually coughed or sneezed out, or swallowed and destroyed by stomach acids. Thus, it acts as a physical barrier, preventing pathogens from reaching the lungs.</p>"

      "explanation": "<p>The correct answer is <strong>Option D: ELISA Technique</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Option A: Hybridization Technique</strong> - This technique, including Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH), involves the pairing of single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules with complementary sequences, allowing the detection of specific nucleic acids within a complex mixture. It's widely used for gene mapping, diagnosis of genetic disorders, and identification of infectious agents. However, its application is more towards locating specific sequences rather than early detection of diseases.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option B: Western Blotting Technique</strong> - This is a protein analysis method that involves the separation of proteins via gel electrophoresis, followed by their transfer to a membrane and detection using antibodies. It's used for identifying specific proteins in a sample and understanding protein size or abundance, but it is not primarily used for early disease detection.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option C: Southern Blotting Technique</strong> - This method involves the transfer of DNA fragments from an agarose gel to a membrane followed by hybridization with a labeled DNA probe to detect specific DNA sequences. It's widely used in molecular biology for gene detection and mapping but not necessarily for early disease detection.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option D: ELISA Technique</strong> - The Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) is a popular technique used for detecting and quantifying substances such as peptides, proteins, antibodies, and hormones. In the context of disease detection, ELISA is exceptionally valuable because it can be used to detect specific antigens or antibodies in blood samples, making it a crucial tool for early diagnosis of diseases. This might include viral infections (like HIV), bacterial infections, and autoimmune diseases. Its sensitivity and specificity make ELISA particularly useful for early detection, when the levels of the target molecule might be very low but detecting it is critical for effective treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, for early detection of diseases, the <strong>ELISA Technique</strong> stands out among the options given for its ability to detect specific biomolecules related to diseases at an early stage, facilitating early diagnosis and treatment.</p>"

This envelope is derived from the host cell's membrane and contains proteins necessary for the virus to attach and enter new host cells. Inside the envelope, HIV has a core structure that carries its genetic material and enzymes essential for its replication. The genetic material of HIV is composed of two identical molecules of single-stranded RNA. This characteristic is crucial for its replication process and is a hallmark of retroviruses, the family to which HIV belongs.</p>\n<p>The presence of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme carried by HIV, is also a defining feature of retroviruses. This enzyme allows the virus to reverse transcribe its RNA genome into DNA once it has entered a host cell. The newly formed viral DNA can then integrate into the host cell's genome, where it can lie dormant or be used to produce new viral particles. HIV carries two molecules of reverse transcriptase, which is consistent with its need to reverse transcribe both of its RNA strands into DNA.</p>\n<p>Therefore, options A, B, and C do not accurately describe HIV:</p>\n<p><b>Option A</b> incorrectly states that HIV is an unenveloped retrovirus, while it is, in fact, enveloped.</p>\n<p><b>Option B</b> is close but misses the detail that HIV contains two, not one, molecules of single-stranded RNA, and similarly, contains two molecules of reverse transcriptase, not just one.</p>\n<p><b>Option C</b> incorrectly suggests that HIV does not evade the immune system. In reality, HIV has evolved multiple strategies to avoid and undermine the host's immune response, contributing to its ability to cause long-term infections.</p>"

Colostrum, the first form of milk produced by mammals immediately following delivery of the newborn, is indeed recommended for newborns, but not merely because it is rich in antigens. It contains a variety of beneficial components like antibodies (especially IgA), growth factors, and nutrients. The antibodies are crucial for passive immunity which protects the infant from infections during the early days of life. Therefore, the rationale behind recommending colostrum is not just because it is 'rich in antigen' but because it contains antibodies and other immune components essential for the newborn's defense.</p>\n\n<p>(B) Chikungunya is caused by a Gram-negative bacterium.</p>\n<p>This statement is false. Chikungunya is not caused by a bacterium at all; rather, it is a viral disease caused by the Chikungunya virus, which is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes, namely Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The categorization of bacteria as Gram-negative or Gram-positive is based on their cell wall composition and staining properties, which are irrelevant to viruses like the Chikungunya virus.</p>\n\n<p>(C) Tissue culture has proved useful in obtaining virus-free plants.</p>\n<p>This statement is true. Tissue culture techniques can be used to produce virus-free plants by culturing tissues from plants that are infected with a virus, and then using a technique called meristem culture, which often results in the production of new, virus-free plants. This is an important practice in agriculture and horticulture for maintaining the health and productivity of crops.</p>\n\n<p>(D) Beer is manufactured by distillation of fermented grape juice.</p>\n<p>This statement is false. Beer is usually made from the fermentation of cereal grains, primarily barley, although other grains can be used. The production of beer involves malting, mashing, boiling, fermenting, conditioning, filtering, and packaging. Distillation is not a part of the beer brewing process; it is a process used in the production of spirits. Furthermore, fermented grape juice results in wine, not beer.</p>\n\n<p>Considering the above explanations: statement (B) is unquestionably wrong; statement (D) is also wrong; and, while statement (A) contains an element of truth, the wording is misleading and could be considered incorrect for the purpose of this question. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that:</p>\n\n<p>Three out of the four given statements are wrong, which corresponds with Option D: Three.</p>"

It is called \"ringworm\" because the infection can cause a ring-shaped, red, itchy rash on the skin. The fungi that cause ringworm are known as dermatophytes, and they live on the dead outer layer of skin, hair, and nails. They thrive in warm, moist environments, which is why they are commonly found in places like locker rooms and swimming pools and can be spread through direct contact with an infected person or animal or through contact with contaminated objects or surfaces.</p>\n\n<p>There are different types of fungi that can cause ringworm, including <i>Trichophyton</i>, <i>Microsporum</i>, and <i>Epidermophyton</i>. These fungi can infect various parts of the body and lead to conditions such as athlete's foot (tinea pedis), jock itch (tinea cruris), scalp ringworm (tinea capitis), and ringworm of the body (tinea corporis).</p>\n\n<p>Ringworm treatment usually involves antifungal medicines that can be taken orally or applied topically to the affected area.

It is a very serious and chronic condition, but it is less easily transmitted than cough and cold since it usually requires intimate contact or blood transfusion/needle sharing with an infected individual.</li>\n    <li><strong>Option B:</strong> Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites and spread by the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. It is not directly contagious from person to person like a virus that causes a cough and cold.</li>\n    <li><strong>Option C:</strong> Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). It is transmitted through exposure to infective blood, semen, and other body fluids, but is not as easily spread as a common cold.</li>\n    <li><strong>Option D:</strong> Cough and cold are generally caused by a variety of respiratory viruses. Because they are spread through the air (via coughing, sneezing) and personal contact, they are highly contagious and infect a large number of people easily.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In sum, while the other diseases listed are infectious and can be serious, a cough and cold (Option D) typically have the highest rate of transmission in everyday circumstances, making it the most infectious in terms of how easily it can be spread from person to person.</p>"
