The first land plants evolved during this time, along with the first arthropods to live on land.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Devonian Period</strong> (419.2-358.9 million years ago): This period is often referred to as the \"Age of Fishes\" due to the abundance of fish species that evolved during this time. The first tetrapods (four-legged vertebrates) also emerged in the Devonian.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Carboniferous Period</strong> (358.9-298.9 million years ago): The Carboniferous Period was a time of extensive swamp forests, which gave rise to the vast coal deposits that are mined today. Amphibians and insects diversified during this time.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Permian Period</strong> (298.9-251.9 million years ago): The Permian Period ended with the largest mass extinction event in Earth's history, which wiped out over 90% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial species.

They were the first of the hominins to leave Africa and spread across parts of Europe and Asia. They had a larger brain size compared to earlier human ancestors (with an average capacity of about 900 - 1100 cc), used more complex tools, and were likely able to control fire.</p>\n<p><b>Option B : Neanderthal man -</b> Neanderthals are an extinct species of hominids that lived between about 400,000 and 40,000 years ago in Europe and southwestern to central Asia. They had a brain capacity equal to or slightly larger than that of modern humans, with an average of about 1200 - 1750 cc. They made and used a diverse set of sophisticated tools, controlled fire, lived in shelters, made and wore clothing, were skilled hunters of large animals and also ate plant foods, and occasionally made symbolic or ornamental objects. There is evidence that Neanderthals deliberately buried their dead and occasionally even marked their graves with offerings.</p>\n<p><b>Option C : Homo habilis -</b> Homo habilis is an early human species that lived between approximately 2.1 and 1.5 million years ago. It is considered one of the earliest members of the Homo genus and had a larger brain than earlier hominins, averaging around 650 - 800 cc. They also manufactured primitive tools, giving them their name &#39;handy man&#39;.</p>\n<p><b>Option D : Australopithecus -</b> Australopithecus is a genus of hominins that lived between about 4 and 2 million years ago. They had a smaller brain size (average around 400 - 500 cc) and were more similar to apes in terms of their physical characteristics. Some species of Australopithecus are considered direct ancestors of the Homo genus. Fossil evidence suggests they walked upright, but it&#39;s unclear how much they used tools.</p>\n"

In the case of penguins and dolphins, both are adapted to aquatic environments and have evolved similar adaptations in their body shape and appendages to optimize swimming and diving.\n<br/><br/>\nPenguins and dolphins are not closely related; penguins are birds, while dolphins are mammals. However, they have evolved similar adaptations for swimming, such as streamlined bodies and flippers that are modified for swimming rather than flight or walking.\n<br/><br/>\nAdaptive radiation is a process in which a single ancestral species gives rise to a diverse array of descendant species, each adapted to a different ecological niche. Natural selection is a mechanism of evolution in which individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on those traits to their offspring. Industrial melanism is a phenomenon in which dark-colored individuals of a species become more common in industrialized areas due to environmental pollution.\n<br/><br/>\nSo, option D, \"Convergent evolution,\" is the correct answer."

Examples are\nwings of butterfly and birds, eye of the octopus and\nthe mammals, flippers of penguins &amp; dolphins, etc.\nOn the other hand, divergent evolution involves\ndevelopment of different functional structures along\ndifferent directions due to adaptations to different\nneeds from a common ancestral form. For example, forelimbs of vertebrates (whales, bat, cheetah,\nhuman). Though these perform different functions,\nthey have similar anatomical structures."
