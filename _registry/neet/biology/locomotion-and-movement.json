      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "<p>Let's analyze each statement to determine its correctness regarding the mechanism of muscle contraction:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Statement A: It is initiated by a signal sent by CNS via sensory neuron.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This statement is incorrect because the signal for muscle contraction is sent by the central nervous system (CNS) via a motor neuron, not a sensory neuron. Sensory neurons carry information from sensory receptors to the CNS, whereas motor neurons carry signals from the CNS to muscles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Statement B: Neurotransmitter generates action potential in the sarcolemma.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This statement is correct. When a motor neuron releases the neurotransmitter (typically acetylcholine) at the neuromuscular junction, it binds to receptors on the muscle cell membrane (sarcolemma) and generates an action potential.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Statement C: Increased Ca$$^{++}$$ level leads to the binding of calcium with troponin on actin filaments.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This statement is correct. When the action potential travels along the sarcolemma and into the muscle via T-tubules, it triggers the release of Ca$$^{++}$$ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The increase in Ca$$^{++}$$ levels leads to calcium binding with troponin on actin filaments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Statement D: Masking of active site for actin is activated.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This statement is incorrect. The active sites on actin are initially masked by the protein tropomyosin. When Ca$$^{++}$$ binds to troponin, it causes a conformational change that moves tropomyosin away from the active sites on actin, thus exposing them for myosin binding. Therefore, masking is deactivated rather than activated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Statement E: Utilising the energy from ATP hydrolysis to form cross bridge.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This statement is correct. The hydrolysis of ATP provides the energy necessary for the myosin heads to attach to actin, forming cross-bridges, and to perform the power stroke which leads to muscle contraction.</p>\n\n<p>Based on this analysis, the correct statements are B, C, and E.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The most appropriate answer is Option A (B, C and E only).</strong></p>"

When ligaments are damaged, it can lead to pain, swelling, and a reduced ability to move the joint, contrary to the joint becoming more movable without pain or the bones moving freely without any discomfort.
