This process significantly slows down or completely stops all biological activity, effectively putting the material in a state of suspended animation.</p>\n\n<p>Let's break down the options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option A: Protection of the environment:</strong> While cryopreservation can be used to preserve certain environmental samples like microbial communities or seeds, it's not the primary technique for overall environmental protection. Environmental protection encompasses a wide range of practices, including pollution control, habitat conservation, and resource management.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option B: Protection of Biodiversity hotspots:</strong>  Cryopreservation can play a role in biodiversity conservation by preserving genetic material from endangered species. However, it's not the sole method for protecting biodiversity hotspots. In-situ conservation (protecting species in their natural habitats) is equally crucial.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option C: Preservation of gametes in viable and fertile condition for a long period:</strong> This is the core application of cryopreservation. Gametes (sperm and eggs) are incredibly sensitive to temperature fluctuations and can easily lose their viability. Cryopreservation allows for the long-term storage of these gametes, ensuring their fertility even after years of storage. This is essential for various applications such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) like in-vitro fertilization (IVF)</li>\n\n<li>Preservation of endangered species' genetic material</li>\n\n<li>Storing gametes for future use, such as delaying parenthood</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Option D: In-situ conservation:</strong>  In-situ conservation refers to protecting species within their natural habitats. Cryopreservation is an ex-situ conservation technique, meaning it involves preserving genetic material outside of its natural environment.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, cryopreservation is a valuable tool for preserving the viability and fertility of gametes for extended periods, making it crucial for various scientific, medical, and conservation applications.</p>\n\n<p></p>"

To visualize DNA fragments after separation, a dye that binds to DNA and fluoresces under UV light is used. This dye, often ethidium bromide or SYBR Safe, intercalates between the DNA bases, making the DNA visible under UV light. </p>\n\n<p>Let's look at the other options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option B: Separated DNA can be extracted from gel piece</strong> is correct. DNA fragments can be extracted from the gel by cutting out the desired band and using a method called gel extraction. This allows for further analysis or cloning of the extracted DNA.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option C: Fragment of DNA moves toward anode</strong> is also correct. DNA molecules carry a negative charge due to the phosphate groups in their backbone. In gel electrophoresis, the DNA is loaded into wells at the negative end of the gel. When an electric current is applied, the negatively charged DNA fragments migrate towards the positive electrode (anode). </p>\n\n<p><strong>Option D: Sieving effect of agarose gel helps in separation of DNA fragments</strong> is correct. Agarose gel acts as a sieve, with pores that allow smaller fragments to travel through more easily than larger fragments. This difference in mobility, based on size, allows for separation of DNA fragments.</p>\n\n<p></p>"

The lac operon in E. coli consists of three structural genes: lacZ, lacY, and lacA.

The lac operon is specifically induced by lactose or allolactose (an isomer of lactose), which act as inducers by deactivating the lac repressor. Glucose, on the other hand, represses the lac operon through catabolite repression, a mechanism that ensures the operon is not expressed when glucose is available.

Bacteriophage is a bacterial virus which\ncan infect it, quickly multiply within and destroy\n(lyse) their host (virus) cells. During infection\nbacteriophages inject their DNA into these cells.\nThe injected DNA selectively replicate and are\nexpressed in the host that results in a multiplication\nof phages that ultimately burst out of the cell (by\nlysis). This ability of transferring DNA from the\nphage genome to specific host during infection\nprocess gave scientists the idea that specially\ndesigned phage vectors could be used for gene\ncloning.\n"

Purification usually occurs in separate downstream processing steps.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Option B: Availability of oxygen throughout the process</strong>: This is the primary purpose of a stirred-tank bioreactor. These bioreactors are equipped with an agitation system that helps to mix the contents thoroughly, ensuring uniform distribution of nutrients and maintaining oxygen availability throughout the culture medium. This is particularly important for aerobic microbial processes, where oxygen is a critical component.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Option C: Ensuring anaerobic conditions in the culture vessel</strong>: Stirred-tank bioreactors are typically designed for aerobic processes, where oxygen availability is crucial.

Among the options provided, the one that fits this description is :</p>\n<p>Option C : E.coli restriction endonuclease I</p>\n<p>Restriction endonucleases, also known as restriction enzymes, are enzymes that cut DNA at or near specific recognition nucleotide sequences known as restriction sites. E.coli restriction endonuclease I is an example of such an enzyme, derived from the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli). These enzymes are essential tools in molecular biology, particularly in processes like gene cloning, as they allow for precise cutting and manipulation of DNA.</p>"
