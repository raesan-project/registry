The classic example of this is the flower color in Antirrhinum (snapdragon). In this case, the heterozygous flowers have a color that is a blend of both parental colors, which is different from either homozygous parent. Therefore, Incomplete dominance matches with \"Flower colour in Antirrhinum\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>Co-dominance</strong>: This refers to a situation where both alleles in a heterozygote are fully expressed, resulting in a phenotype that displays both traits equally. A common example of this is blood groups in humans. In the case of the ABO blood group system, both A and B alleles are expressed in individuals with AB blood type. Therefore, Co-dominance matches with \"Blood groups in human\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pleiotropy</strong>: This occurs when one gene influences multiple traits. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an example where a single genetic defect in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene results in multiple symptoms in different organs. Therefore, Pleiotropy matches with \"Phenylketonuria\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>Polygenic inheritance</strong>: This refers to situations where multiple genes influence a single trait. An example of this is skin color in humans, where multiple genes contribute to the phenotype. Therefore, Polygenic inheritance matches with \"Skin colour in human\".</p>\n\n<p>Based on this analysis, the correct matching would be:</p>\n\n<p>(A) Incomplete dominance - (II) Flower colour in Antirrhinum</p>\n\n<p>(B) Co-dominance - (I) Blood groups in human</p>\n\n<p>(C) Pleiotropy - (IV) Phenylketonuria</p>\n\n<p>(D) Polygenic inheritance - (III) Skin colour in human</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the correct option is:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option B:</strong> A-II, B-I, C-IV, D-III</p>"

      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "<p>To determine the chances that the daughter would be color blind, we need to understand the genetics of color blindness. Color blindness is most commonly caused by defects in the X chromosome, and it is a recessive trait. Since males (XY) have only one X chromosome and females (XX) have two, a male will be color blind if his single X chromosome carries the defect. A female, on the other hand, would need to have the defect on both of her X chromosomes to express color blindness since it is recessive.</p>\n\n<p>Given that the man has normal vision, we can infer that his X chromosome (which he got from his mother) does not have the color blindness defect; however, because his father was color blind, we know that he carries a Y chromosome without the color blindness trait (otherwise, the man would be color blind too). The man will pass on either his X or his Y chromosome to his offspring. If it's a daughter, he will pass on the X chromosome, which we know does not carry the color blindness defect.</p>\n\n<p>The woman's father was color blind, meaning her father's only X chromosome carried the defect. Since women have two X chromosomes, the one she received from her mother could potentially not have the defect. Therefore, the woman can be heterozygous (one normal X chromosome and one with the color blindness defect) or homozygous normal (both X chromosomes without the defect). However, the problem does not provide information about the mother's vision or genotype to confirm whether she is a carrier or not. If the woman is not a carrier, none of her children would inherit color blindness. If she is a carrier, then there's a 50% chance she could pass on the X chromosome with the defect.</p>\n\n<p>So, let's consider the two potential scenarios for the woman, represented by X (normal X chromosome) and X^c (X chromosome with color blindness defect):</p>\n\n<p>1. The woman is a carrier (X X^c): There's a 50% chance she might pass on the X chromosome with the defect (X^c) since she is heterozygous.</p>\n\n<p>2. The woman is not a carrier (X X): There's a 0% chance the child will be color blind since all her X chromosomes are without the color blindness defect.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If the woman is a carrier, the daughter has a 50% chance of getting the X^c chromosome from her mother and would then be a carrier like her mother (heterozygous), but will not be color blind because the X chromosome from her father is normal.</li>\n<li>If the woman is not a carrier, then the daughter has a 0% chance of being color blind because both of her parents would provide normal X chromosomes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Because we don't know the mother's carrier status with the information given, we cannot say for certain what the probability is for the daughter to be color blind. However, we know it's either 0% (if the mother is not a carrier) or 50% (if the mother is a carrier) chance of being a carrier, but 0% chance of expressing color blindness since she receives one normal X chromosome from her father. Therefore, the probability that the child would be color blind (express the trait) is:</p>\n\n<p>Option D: Zero percent.</p>"

      "explanation": "<p>According to Mendelian genetics, certain traits are dominant over others. In the options you&#39;ve provided, related to the classic pea plant experiments conducted by Gregor Mendel :</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Option A - Green colour in seed coat</strong> : In Mendel&#39;s experiments, the yellow seed coat was the dominant trait over the green seed coat.</p>\n</li>\n<br/><li><p><strong>Option B - Wrinkled seed</strong> : Smooth or round seeds were dominant over wrinkled seeds.</p>\n</li>\n<br/><li><p><strong>Option C - Terminal position of flower</strong> : This refers to the position of the flower on the plant. Flowers at the end of the stem (terminal) were recessive compared to flowers along the stem (axial).</p>\n</li>\n<br/><li><p><strong>Option D - Green pod colour</strong> : Green pod colour was indeed a dominant trait over yellow pod colour in Mendel&#39;s experiments.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Based on this, the character showing dominance among the options is <strong>Option D - Green pod colour</strong>.</p>"
