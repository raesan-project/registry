      "explanation": "<p>The correct answer is <strong>Option C: It accommodates a food web</strong>. Here's why:</p>\n\n<p>Ecological pyramids are a visual representation of the trophic levels in an ecosystem, depicting the flow of energy and biomass. However, they have limitations in accurately representing the complexities of real-world ecosystems.</p>\n\n<p>Let's analyze each option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option A: Saprophytes are not given any place in ecological pyramids</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is a <strong>valid limitation</strong>. Saprophytes, organisms that decompose dead organic matter, play a crucial role in nutrient cycling but are often not included in traditional ecological pyramids.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option B: It assumes a simple food chain, that almost never exists in nature</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is another <strong>valid limitation</strong>. Most ecosystems have intricate food webs, with organisms feeding on multiple trophic levels.  Ecological pyramids struggle to capture these complex interrelationships.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option C: It accommodates a food web</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is <strong>incorrect</strong>. Ecological pyramids are fundamentally based on simple food chains,  not food webs.  The complex interactions of a food web, where organisms occupy multiple trophic levels simultaneously, are difficult to represent using a pyramid.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option D: It does not take into account the same species belonging to two or more trophic levels</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is another <strong>valid limitation</strong>. For example, a species like an omnivore might consume both producers and herbivores, making it difficult to categorize them in a single trophic level. </p>\n\n<p><strong>In summary</strong>, ecological pyramids are useful tools for visualizing energy flow and biomass distribution within an ecosystem. However, they are simplified models that cannot fully capture the complexity of real-world food webs and ecological relationships.</p>\n\n<p></p>"

The food chain reads as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plant → insect → frog → \"A\" → Eagle</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let's analyze the options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Option A: Wolf -</strong> Wolves are generally not part of a food chain that includes eagles because they are both top predators, and it is unlikely for a wolf to be preyed upon by an eagle.</li>\n<li><strong>Option B: Rabbit -</strong> Rabbits primarily eat plants and would not be found in this part of the food chain after the frog. They are not typically a prey item for eagles after a frog in a direct food chain sequence.</li>\n<li><strong>Option C: Cobra -</strong> Cobras can eat frogs, making them a suitable link in the food chain. In some ecosystems, large eagles, especially those adapted to hunting snakes like the Serpent Eagle, may prey on cobras.</li>\n<li><strong>Option D: Parrot -</strong> Parrots are primarily herbivores or omnivores with a diet consisting mainly of seeds, nuts, and fruit. They are not typically part of a food chain where frogs are a preceding link and do not generally fall prey to eagles in the context of this type of food chain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Considering the ecology of these animals, the most likely organism to fill the role of \"A\" between the frog and the eagle is the cobra, as it can be a natural predator to the frog and in turn can be prey for certain types of eagles.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the correct answer is <strong>Option C: Cobra</strong>.</p>"

      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Green manures are fast growing herbaceous\ncrops which are ploughed down and mixed with the\nsoil while still green for enrichment of soil. These\nprovide both organic matter and nitrogen to the soil,\nin which Indian soils are generally poor. The green\nmanure checks soil erosion by forming protective soil\ncover and also prevents leaching. Increase in yield\nby 30-50% has been observed by use of green\nmanures. Some important green manure crops, which\nare mostly members of Family Leguminosae are\nAlhagi and Crotolaria juncea.\n"

      "explanation": "The benthic region includes all the sea\nfloor from the wave-washed shore-line to the greatest\ndepths. Depending upon the penetration of light it\nis subdivided into two main zones : the lighted or\nlittoral zone and the deep sea system. Due to\nabundance of light, water, oxygen, carbon dioxide\nand less salinity of water, the tidal zone is\ncharacterized by exhorbitant growth of plants. The\ndense growth of vegetation, on the other hand,\nprovides shelter and food for animals. A wide variety\nof algae, few grasses and animals of every phylum\nof animal kingdom are represented in this region."
