All GAs are acidic in nature.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This statement is <strong>true</strong>. Gibberellins (GAs) are a group of plant hormones that are primarily known for their role in stem elongation, seed germination, and flowering.  Their chemical structure features a characteristic carboxyl group (COOH), making them acidic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>B. Auxins are antagonists to GAs.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This statement is <strong>false</strong>. While auxins and GAs can have opposing effects in some cases, they generally act synergistically,  meaning they work together to enhance each other's effects. For example, both auxins and GAs can promote stem elongation, and their combined action can result in more pronounced growth than either hormone alone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>C. Zeatin was isolated from coconut milk.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This statement is <strong>true</strong>. Zeatin is a naturally occurring cytokinin, a class of plant hormones that promote cell division. It was first isolated from coconut milk, a rich source of plant growth regulators.</p>\n\n<p><strong>D. Ethylene induces flowering in Mango.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This statement is <strong>true</strong>. Ethylene, a gaseous plant hormone, plays a crucial role in fruit ripening and can also induce flowering in certain plant species, including Mango. Ethylene treatment can be used to synchronize flowering in Mango trees, leading to more efficient fruit production.</p>\n\n<p><strong>E. Abscisic acid induces parthenocarpy.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This statement is <strong>false</strong>. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone primarily known for its role in stress responses, such as drought tolerance and dormancy. It does not induce parthenocarpy, which is the development of fruit without fertilization. Parthenocarpy can be induced by other hormones, such as auxins and gibberellins, depending on the plant species.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the correct statements are A, C, and D, making <strong>Option A</strong> the correct choice.</p>\n\n<p></p>"

Its effect varies depending on the plant species and its developmental stage. The given options can be assessed to understand why grass remains undamaged in lawns treated with auxin for weed control.</p>\n\n<p>Option A: promotes apical dominance. <br>\nApical dominance refers to the phenomenon where the main, central stem of the plant grows more dominantly than the side stems due to the concentration of auxin in the apex. This is not relevant to the selective action of auxin on weeds versus grass, because while it might affect growth patterns, it doesn’t relate directly to why weeds are eliminated and grass is not. </p>\n\n<p>Option B: promotes abscission of mature leaves only. <br>\nAbscission is the process where parts of a plant, such as leaves or fruit, are shed. Auxin helps delay abscission by inhibiting the process. Thus, promoting abscission does not align with the characteristic actions of auxin. Additionally, this mechanism would not be selective for weeds over grass. </p>\n\n<p>Option C: does not affect mature monocotyledonous plants. <br>\nGrasses are monocotyledonous plants, characterized by having one seed leaf, parallel leaf veins, and vascular bundles scattered in stem sections. It is known that the structure and growth patterns of monocots differ sufficiently from dicots; hence, many dicot-specific herbicides (including those based on auxin-like substances) do not affect monocots. Therefore, this option provides a plausible explanation why grass, a monocot, remains unaffected by a treatment intended for dicot weeds.</p>\n\n<p>Option D: can help in cell division in grasses, to produce growth. <br>\nWhile auxin does promote cell division and growth in plants, this is a generalized action and does not explain why it would selectively not harm grass when used as a weed killer in lawns. </p>\n\n<p>Based on the analysis above, the correct answer is <strong>Option C</strong>: does not affect mature monocotyledonous plants. This option directly addresses the differential effect of auxin on monocots versus dicots, aligning with the observed outcome that grass remains undamaged while dicot weeds are targeted.</p>"

This newly formed meristematic tissue can then differentiate into specialized tissues once again, in this case, forming interfascicular cambium.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, differentiation (Option A) is the process where cells develop from a less specialized form to a more specialized form.

Gibberellins (GAs) are a group of plant hormones that play a crucial role in regulating various aspects of plant growth and development. One of the notable effects of gibberellins is their ability to promote stem elongation by stimulating cell division and elongation.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of sugarcane, a crop that is valued for its stem (from which sucrose is extracted), applying gibberellin can increase the length of the stem, thereby potentially increasing the yield of the crop. This increase in stem length due to gibberellin application is primarily because gibberellins overcome the inhibitory effects of other hormones that suppress growth; they stimulate the cells in the stems to grow larger and divide more frequently.</p>\n\n<p>While Auxin (Option A) and Cytokinins (Option C) also influence plant growth and have their specific uses, such as rooting and promoting cell division, respectively, they do not primarily target stem elongation to the extent gibberellins do.

This played a major role in the discovery of auxin, which is one of the main plant hormones. </p>\n<p>While auxins do also influence other processes like root initiation, gravitropism, and apical dominance, their role in phototropism was significant to their discovery. </p>\n<p>So, based on your question, phototropism (Option A) is the correct answer.</p>"

It is important for plants as it is a\ncomponent of nucleic acids, proteins, chlorophyll and\ncytochromes. Deficiency of nitrogen causes poor root\ndevelopment, lower respiration rate, chlorosis of older\nleaves, etc. Cytokinins are also very important for\nplant development. They are associated with the\ncontrol of apical dominance, fruit development, root\ngrowth, cambial activity. So a nitrogenous fertilizer\nlike NPK and cytokinins are most beneficial to the\nplant.\n"
