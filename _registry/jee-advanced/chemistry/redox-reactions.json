In the permanganate ion, there are four oxygens, contributing a total of $4 \\times (-2) = -8$ to the charge. The overall charge of the $MnO_4^-$ ion is -1, which means the oxidation state of Mn must balance the charge contributed by oxygen to achieve the overall -1 charge. Thus, if we let the oxidation state of Mn be x, we have:</p>\n\n<p>$$x + 4(-2) = -1$$</p>\n\n<p>Solving for x gives:</p>\n\n<p>$$x - 8 = -1 \\Rightarrow x = +7$$</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option B: $Cr(CN)_6^{3-}$</strong></p>\n\n<p>For the $Cr(CN)_6^{3-}$ ion, cyanide $(CN)^-$ is a ligand with a -1 charge. With six cyanide ions, the total charge contributed by the ligands is $6 \\times (-1) = -6$. The overall charge of the complex is -3, which means the oxidation state of Cr must offset the ligands' charge to achieve the overall -3 charge. Letting the oxidation state of Cr be x, we can set up the equation:</p>\n\n<p>$$x + 6(-1) = -3$$</p>\n\n<p>Solving for x gives:</p>\n\n<p>$$x - 6 = -3 \\Rightarrow x = +3$$</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option C: $NiF_6^{2-}$</strong></p>\n\n<p>In $NiF_6^{2-}$, the fluoride ion $(F^-)$ has an oxidation state of -1. With six fluoride ions, the total charge from the fluoride ions is $6 \\times (-1) = -6$. For the complex to have an overall charge of -2, the oxidation state of Ni (let's call it x) needs to satisfy the following equation:</p>\n\n<p>$$x + 6(-1) = -2$$</p>\n\n<p>Solving for x gives:</p>\n\n<p>$$x - 6 = -2 \\Rightarrow x = +4$$</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option D: $CrO_2Cl_2$</strong></p>\n\n<p>In chromium dioxide dichloride, we have two oxygen atoms and two chlorine atoms bonded to chromium. Oxygen has a typical oxidation state of -2, and chlorine has a typical oxidation state of -1. However, being in a molecule (not an ion), the total must sum to zero. Let the oxidation state of Cr be x; we can set up the equation as follows:</p>\n\n<p>$$x + 2(-2) + 2(-1) = 0$$</p>\n\n<p>This simplifies to:</p>\n\n<p>$$x - 4 - 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = +6$$</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> From the analysis above, the species with a chromium atom in the +6 oxidation state is found in Option D: $CrO_2Cl_2$.</p>"

The equivalent weight of a compound in a given reaction depends on the change in oxidation number per atom of the element in question. It is calculated as the molecular weight divided by the number of electrons lost or gained in the reaction.</p>\n\n<p>The molecular weight of $MnSO_4$ (Manganese(II) sulfate) is primarily irrelevant for the specifics of calculating equivalent weight in this manner; what's crucial is the stoichiometry of the electron transfer involved in its reaction.</p>\n\n<p>Let's consider the oxidation state of Mn in $MnSO_4$, which is +2.</p>\n\n<p>Option A: $Mn_2O_3$</p>\n\n<p>Mn's oxidation state in $Mn_2O_3$ is +3. Thus, going from +2 in $MnSO_4$ to +3 in $Mn_2O_3$ involves a loss (or gain) of 1 electron per manganese atom. Given that there are two Mn atoms in $Mn_2O_3$, this would not match the stated requirement directly without considering the specifics of the individual reaction stoichiometry.</p>\n\n<p>Option B: $MnO_2$</p>\n\n<p>The oxidation state of Mn in $MnO_2$ is +4. The change from +2 to +4 implies a gain or loss of 2 electrons.</p>\n\n<p>Option C: $MnO_4^-$ (Permanganate)</p>\n\n<p>In $MnO_4^-$, the oxidation state of Mn is +7. The change from +2 in $MnSO_4$ to +7 in $MnO_4^-$ involves a change of 5 electrons.</p>\n\n<p>Option D: $MnO_4^{2-}$</p>\n\n<p>This oxidation state is not typically encountered for manganese and may represent a mistaken formulation, as Mn typically shows +7 oxidation state in permanganate $(MnO_4^-)$, not a doubly charged anion.</p>\n\n<p>Given these considerations, the question's conditions mention that the equivalent weight of $MnSO_4$ becomes half of its molecular weight when it converts to one of these products. This would imply a situation where the number of electrons transferred per formula unit of $MnSO_4$ is equivalent to 2 (since the molecular weight divided by 2 equals the equivalent weight when each mole of $MnSO_4$ involves the transfer of 2 moles of electrons).</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the correct answer is:</p>\n\n<p>Option B: $MnO_2$, because the conversion from $Mn^{+2}$ to $Mn^{+4}$ involves a transfer of 2 electrons per manganese atom, which fits the condition that the equivalent weight is half the molecular weight in this context.</p>"

      "explanation": "<p>First, let's understand the given information. We have hydrazine (N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>) losing 10 moles of electrons to form a new compound (Y). In this context, the oxidation state of hydrogen remains unchanged, which is +1.</p>\n\n<p>To solve this problem, we should follow these steps:</p>\n\n<p>1. Determine the initial oxidation state of nitrogen in N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>.<br>\n\n<p>In N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, hydrogen is in the +1 oxidation state. Since the molecule is neutral, the sum of oxidation states must equal 0. We can express this relationship as:<br></p>\n\n<p>2x + 4(+1) = 0<br></p>\n\n<p>Where x is the oxidation state of one nitrogen atom. This can be rearranged to find x:<br></p>\n\n<p>2x = -4<br></p>\n\n<p>x = -2<br></p>\n\n<p>So, the initial oxidation state of nitrogen in N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> is -2.</p></p>\n\n<p>2. Determine the change in oxidation state of nitrogen.<br>\n\n<p>When 1 mole of N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> loses 10 moles of electrons, the nitrogen atoms undergo oxidation, meaning their oxidation state increases. The loss of 10 electrons per mole of N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> means that there's an increase of 5 oxidation states per nitrogen atom, because there are 2 nitrogen atoms in each molecule of N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>.</p></p>\n\n<p>3. Calculate the final oxidation state of nitrogen.<br>\n\n<p>The initial oxidation state of nitrogen is -2. With the loss of electrons, the oxidation state increases by 5 for each nitrogen atom:<br></p>\n\n<p>Final oxidation state = Initial oxidation state + Increase in oxidation state<br></p>\n\n<p>Final oxidation state of nitrogen = -2 + 5 = +3</p></p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the oxidation state of nitrogen in the new compound Y is +3.</p>\n\n<p>The correct answer is Option C: +3.</p>"
