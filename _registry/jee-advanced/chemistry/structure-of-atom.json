This is because for hydrogen-like species, the number of radial nodes is given by $n-1$, where $n$ is the principal quantum number.

For hydrogen ($Z=1$), the ground state energy ($n=1$) is:</p>\n\n<p>$$E = -E_0$$</p>\n\n<p>For the Li$^{2+}$ ion in state $S_2$ (which we established is equivalent to $n=2$ in terms of energy for hydrogen), we use the formula $E_n = -\\frac{Z^2}{n^2} E_0$.

In this experiment, a beam of alpha particles, which are essentially helium nuclei (comprising two protons and two neutrons, and thus positively charged), was directed at a thin gold foil. Most of the alpha particles passed through the foil with little to no deflection, which suggested that atoms are mostly empty space. However, a small fraction of the alpha particles were deflected at large angles, and a very few even bounced back towards the source. This observation was unexpected based on the prevailing model of the atom at the time, which was J.J. Thomson's \"plum pudding\" model where the atom was thought to be a uniform sphere of positive charge with electrons embedded within it.</p>\n\n<p>The results of Rutherford's experiment led him to propose a new model of the atom, known as the nuclear model. In this model, an atom consists of a small, dense nucleus that contains most of the atom's mass and all of its positive charge, surrounded by electrons that occupy the remaining vast space of the atom. The nucleus is tiny compared to the overall size of the atom, explaining why most alpha particles passed through the foil unimpeded. The large deflections occurred when an alpha particle came close to the nucleus, being repelled by its positive charge. This discovery was fundamental in moving away from the idea of an atom as a homogenous sphere to an atom with a dense central nucleus around which electrons orbit.</p>"

In simpler terms, it means that each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons, and these two electrons must have opposite spins. The quantum numbers that define an electron's state in an atom include the principal quantum number (n), the angular momentum quantum number (l), the magnetic quantum number (m<sub>l</sub>), and the spin quantum number (m<sub>s</sub>).</p>\n\n<p>The electronic configuration given as 1s<sup>7</sup> would imply trying to place seven electrons into the 1s orbital. However, an s orbital can accommodate a maximum of two electrons, provided they have opposite spins. This arrangement means that trying to place more than two electrons in the 1s orbital would indeed violate the Pauli exclusion principle because it would require at least some of these electrons to have the same set of quantum numbers, which is not possible.</p>\n\n<p>Let's briefly address why the other options do not fit:</p>\n\n<p>Option A: Heisenberg uncertainty principle concerns itself with the limit to which the position and momentum (or velocity) of an electron can be known simultaneously. This principle does not directly relate to the issue of how many electrons can occupy a given orbital or energy level.</p>\n\n<p>Option B: Hund's rule deals with the distribution of electrons across orbitals of the same energy (degeneracy). It states that electrons will fill each degenerate orbital singly before any orbital gets a second electron, and all singly occupied orbitals will have electrons with the same spin. This rule does not apply to the violation seen in the 1s<sup>7</sup> configuration.</p>\n\n<p>Option D: Bohr's postulate of stationary orbits pertains to the quantum condition that electrons orbit the nucleus in certain stable orbits without radiating energy. This principle is more historical and foundational to quantum theory and does not address the occupancy limits of orbitals or the exclusion principle directly.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the concept violated by having a 1s<sup>7</sup> configuration is the Pauli exclusion principle (Option C), as this configuration suggests more than two electrons attempting to occupy the same quantum state within the 1s orbital, which is not permissible.</p>"

Generally, the energy of an electron increases with an increase in the $n$ value. However, for electrons within the same $n$ level, those with higher $l$ values have slightly higher energies due to electron penetration and shielding effects.

Zinc sulfide (ZnS) is one such material that fluoresces upon exposure to X-rays. This property is utilized in X-ray screens and detectors.</p></p>\n\n<p><strong>Option C: Deflected by electric and magnetic fields</strong><br>\n\n<p>This statement is false in the context of X-rays and is what sets them apart from charged particles. X-rays, being electromagnetic radiation, are not deflected by electric or magnetic fields. This property is contrasted with charged particles such as electrons, which can be deflected by these fields. Electromagnetic waves, including X-rays, propagate in a straight line and are unaffected by electric and magnetic fields because they carry no charge.</p></p>\n\n<p><strong>Option D: Have wavelengths shorter than ultraviolet rays</strong><br>\n\n<p>X-rays do indeed have wavelengths shorter than ultraviolet rays. The electromagnetic spectrum is ordered by wavelength and frequency, with X-rays situated between ultraviolet rays and gamma rays. The shorter the wavelength, the higher the energy of the electromagnetic waves. X-rays typically have wavelengths in the range of 0.01 to 10 nanometers, indicating higher energy and allowing them to penetrate many materials.</p></p>"

They observed the scattering of these alpha particles, expecting most to pass straight through the foil with minimal deflection, as was predicted by the plum pudding model of the atom prevalent at the time.

He suggested that instead of being distributed throughout the atom, as the plum pudding model proposed, the positive charge (and most of the atom's mass) was concentrated in a very small, dense region at the center of the atom. He called this the nucleus. The electrons then occupied the space around the nucleus, much like planets orbiting the sun.

      "explanation": "<p>To determine the number of metals that will show the photoelectric effect when light of 300 nm wavelength falls on them, we first need to calculate the energy (in eV) of the incident photons. The energy ($E$) of a photon can be calculated using the formula:</p>\n\n<p>$E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$</p>\n\n<p>where</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$h$ is Planck's constant ($6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s),</li><br>\n<li>$c$ is the speed of light ($3.00 \\times 10^{8}$ m/s),</li><br>\n<li>$\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light (in meters).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>First, convert the wavelength from nm to meters:</p>\n\n<p>$300\\, \\text{nm} = 300 \\times 10^{-9}\\, \\text{m}$</p>\n\n<p>Then, calculate the energy of the photons:</p>\n\n<p>$E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34}\\, \\text{J·s}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^{8}\\, \\text{m/s})}{300 \\times 10^{-9}\\, \\text{m}}$</p>\n\n<p>$E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 3.00) \\times 10^{-19}}{300}\\, \\text{J}$</p>\n\n<p>$E = \\frac{19.878 \\times 10^{-19}}{300}\\, \\text{J}$</p>\n\n<p>$E \\approx 6.626 \\times 10^{-19}\\, \\text{J}$</p>\n\n<p>To convert the energy from joules to electron volts (eV), we divide by the charge of an electron ($1.602 \\times 10^{-19}$ C):</p>\n\n<p>$E \\approx \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-19}\\, \\text{J}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\, \\text{C/e^-}} \\approx 4.14\\, \\text{eV}$</p>\n\n<p>Now, to determine whether the photoelectric effect will occur, we compare the energy of the incident photons to the work function ($\\phi$) of each metal. The photoelectric effect occurs if the photon energy is greater than or equal to the work function of the metal:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For Li ($\\phi = 2.4\\, \\text{eV}$): Yes, $4.14\\, \\text{eV} > 2.4\\, \\text{eV}$</li><br>\n<li>For Na ($\\phi = 2.3\\, \\text{eV}$): Yes, $4.14\\, \\text{eV} > 2.3\\, \\text{eV}$</li><br>\n<li>For K ($\\phi = 2.2\\, \\text{eV}$): Yes, $4.14\\, \\text{eV} > 2.2\\, \\text{eV}$</li><br>\n<li>For Mg ($\\phi = 3.7\\, \\text{eV}$): Yes, $4.14\\, \\text{eV} > 3.7\\, \\text{eV}$</li><br>\n<li>For Cu ($\\phi = 4.8\\, \\text{eV}$): No, $4.14\\, \\text{eV} < 4.8\\, \\text{eV}$</li><br>\n<li>For Ag ($\\phi = 4.3\\, \\text{eV}$): No, $4.14\\, \\text{eV} < 4.3\\, \\text{eV}$</li><br>\n<li>For Fe ($\\phi = 4.7\\, \\text{eV}$): No, $4.14\\, \\text{eV} < 4.7\\, \\text{eV}$</li><br>\n<li>For Pt ($\\phi = 6.3\\, \\text{eV}$): No, $4.14\\, \\text{eV} < 6.3\\, \\text{eV}$</li><br>\n<li>For W ($\\phi = 4.75\\, \\text{eV}$): No, $4.14\\, \\text{eV} < 4.75\\, \\text{eV}$</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thus, the number of metals which will show the photoelectric effect when light of 300 nm wavelength falls on the metal is 4 (Li, Na, K, Mg).</p>"
