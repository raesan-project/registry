This is a typical boiling process.</p>\n\n<p>First, let's consider the change in entropy, $$\\Delta S_{\\text{system}}$$, of the water itself (the system). When water boils and changes from a liquid to a gas, the molecules spread out significantly, occupying a larger volume and showing greater randomness in their motion. This transition from a more ordered phase (liquid) to a less ordered phase (gas) results in an increase in entropy. Thus, $$\\Delta S_{\\text{system}}>0$$.</p>\n\n<p>Next, let's consider the change in entropy of the surroundings, $$\\Delta S_{\\text{surroundings}}$$. When the water boils at 100°C, it must absorb heat to do so. This heat is typically taken from the surroundings. As the surroundings lose heat, according to the formula for entropy change $$\\Delta S = \\frac{q}{T}$$, where $$q$$ is the heat transferred and $$T$$ is the temperature, the surroundings lose entropy if the process is happening at a constant temperature as typically assumed in such cases. Therefore, here $$\\Delta S_{\\text{surroundings}}<0$$ as heat loss by surroundings (negative $$q$$) results in a decrease in entropy.</p>\n\n<p>Combining these insights, we find:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The entropy of the system increases ($$\\Delta S_{\\text{system}}>0$$).</li>\n\n<li>The entropy of the surroundings decreases ($$\\Delta S_{\\text{surroundings}}<0$$).</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<b>Option B</b>: $$\\Delta S_{\\text{system}}>0$$ and $$\\Delta S_{\\text{surroundings}}<0$$.</p>"

      "explanation": "<p>To find the standard enthalpy of combustion of glucose, we will first write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of glucose. The chemical formula for glucose is $ C_6H_{12}O_6 $. Combustion involves the reaction of a substance with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and water (H<sub>2</sub>O) typically. The reaction for the combustion of glucose can be represented as:</p>\n\n$$\nC_6H_{12}O_6 (s) + 6O_2 (g) \\rightarrow 6CO_2 (g) + 6H_2O (l)\n$$\n\n<p>Each molecule of glucose (C6H12O6) produces six molecules of CO<sub>2</sub> and six molecules of H<sub>2</sub>O. Now, we use the given standard enthalpies of formation (ΔH<sub>f</sub>°) for these substances to find the enthalpy of the reaction. The enthalpy of a reaction can be calculated using the formula:</p>\n\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\text{reaction}} = \\sum \\Delta H_{f,\\text{products}} - \\sum \\Delta H_{f,\\text{reactants}}\n$$\n\n<p>For the given reaction:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ΔH<sub>f</sub>° of CO<sub>2</sub>(g) = –400 kJ/mol</li>\n<li>ΔH<sub>f</sub>° of H<sub>2</sub>O(l) = –300 kJ/mol</li>\n<li>ΔH<sub>f</sub>° of glucose(s) = –1300 kJ/mol</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the products:</p>\n\n$$\n[6 \\times (-400) \\text{ kJ/mol}] + [6 \\times (-300) \\text{ kJ/mol}] = (-2400 + -1800) \\text{ kJ} = -4200 \\text{ kJ}\n$$\n\n<p>The sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants (glucose as only part contributing with enthalpy value other than zero):</p>\n\n$$\n[-1300 \\text{ kJ/mol}] + [6 \\times 0 \\text{ kJ/mol for } O_2]\n$$\n\n<p>Therefore, the standard enthalpy of combustion of glucose is:</p>\n\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\text{reaction}} =  (-4200 \\text{ kJ}) - (-1300 \\text{ kJ}) = -2900 \\text{ kJ}\n$$\n\n<p>So, -2900 kJ of energy is released per mole of glucose combusted at standard conditions. The standard enthalpy of combustion per gram of glucose can be calculated using the molar mass of glucose. Glucose has a molar mass of approximately 180 g/mol.</p>\n\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\text{combustion per gram}} = \\frac{-2900 \\text{ kJ/mol}}{180 \\text{ g/mol}} = -16.11 \\text{ kJ/g}\n$$\n\n<p>Thus, the correct answer is -16.11 kJ per gram of glucose, which corresponds to option C  \n–16.11 kJ.</p>"
