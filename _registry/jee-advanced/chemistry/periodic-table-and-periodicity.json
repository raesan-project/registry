      "explanation": "<p>The <b>Assertion</b> states that the first ionization energy of Beryllium (Be) is greater than that of Boron (B). To analyze this, let's consider the electronic configurations and other factors influencing ionization energies. Beryllium (Be) has an electronic configuration of $$1s^2 2s^2$$, while Boron (B) has an electronic configuration of $$1s^2 2s^2 2p^1$$. The first ionization energy refers to the energy required to remove the most loosely held electron from an atom's outer shell. In Beryllium, this electron is removed from a completely filled $$2s$$ orbital, which is a stable state. In Boron, the electron to be removed is from a $$2p$$ orbital, where only one electron is present, and the $$2p$$ orbital is an in-progress shell filling after the $$2s$$ is filled.</p>\n\n<p>The stability associated with Beryllium's filled $$2s$$ orbital typically results in a higher ionization energy compared to Boron, which has an uncompleted subshell with a loosely held $$2p$$ electron. Thus, it is generally easier (less energy required) to remove an electron from the $$2p$$ orbital of Boron than to remove one from the filled $$2s$$ orbital of Beryllium, confirming that the Assertion is correct.</p>\n\n<p>The <b>Reason</b> provided states, \"2p orbital is lower in energy than 2s.\" However, this statement is not precise or accurately phrased in the context of atomic orbital theory.

Understanding these factors can help correctly interpret the order of radii among elements and ions under comparison.</p>\n\n<p>Let's evaluate each of the provided options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option A: N &lt; Be &lt; B</strong></p>\n\n<p>This order considers the atomic radii of neutral atoms across a period in the periodic table (left to right). According to periodic trends, atomic radius decreases as we move from left to right across a period owing to the increase in effective nuclear charge attracting the electrons more strongly. Boron (B) and Beryllium (Be) are both elements in Period 2. Beryllium is to the left of Boron, and Nitrogen (N) is to the right of Boron. Therefore, the correct order should be $Be \\lt B \\lt N$, which contradicts the given order.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option B: F<sup>-</sup> &lt; O<sup>2-</sup> &lt; N<sup>3-</sup></strong></p>\n\n<p>In the case of anions, the ionic radii generally increase with an increase in negative charge due to additional electron-electron repulsion outweighing the increased nuclear charge. Following this, given all anions are isoelectronic, having the same number of electrons, but differing in nuclear charge — fluorine has the highest (9 protons), followed by oxygen (8 protons), and finally nitrogen (7 protons). Thus, larger negative charges on an element with fewer protons result in larger radii because a lesser nuclear charge results in a larger size. N<sup>3-</sup> will be larger than O<sup>2-</sup>, and O<sup>2-</sup> larger than F<sup>-</sup>, making the correct order $F^- < O^{2-} < N^{3-}$, which matches with Option B.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option C: Na &lt; Li &lt; K</strong></p>\n\n<p>Considering atoms of Sodium (Na), Lithium (Li), and Potassium (K), all located in the same group of the periodic table (alkali metals), we generally see an increase in atomic radii as we move down a group due to additional electron shells. The order defined by increasing radius should therefore be $Li < Na < K$. The contrary statement in Option C is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option D: Fe<sup>3+</sup> &lt; Fe<sup>2+</sup> &lt; Fe<sup>4+</sup></strong></p>\n\n<p>The size of a cation decreases with an increase in positive charge, since more electrons are removed, which enhances the effective nuclear charge attracting the remaining electrons more tightly. In iron ions, the order from smallest to largest based on the number of electrons removed (hence increasing charge) is: Fe<sup>4+</sup> (most electrons removed, thus smallest) &lt; Fe<sup>3+</sup> &lt; Fe<sup>2+</sup> (least electrons removed, thus largest).

The modern periodic table is arranged in order of increasing atomic number, and the properties of elements repeat periodically. This periodicity in properties arises due to the similar electronic configurations that occur periodically as the atomic number increases.</p></p>\n\n<p><strong>Option B: Non-metallic elements are lesser in number than metallic elements.</strong><br>\n\n<p>This statement is also correct.

As you move from left to right within a period, the first ionization energy generally increases. However, there are exceptions (such as between Groups II and III where the first ionization energy drops slightly), which means the variation isn't strictly regular or linear but shows a general trend with minor irregularities due to electronic structure differences.</p></p>\n\n<p><strong>Option D: For transition elements, the d-subshells are filled with electrons monotonically with increase in atomic number.</strong><br>\n\n<p>This statement is incorrect, which makes it the answer. In the series of transition elements, the filling of d-subshells with electrons doesn't always happen monotonically (i.e., in a strictly increasing order). The electron configuration of transition metals can appear complex due to the involvement of both 4s and 3d subshells, where electrons may not fill sequentially. A notable exception can be seen in elements like chromium and copper, where electron configurations show anomalies (e.g., $$\\text{Cr: [Ar]} 3d^5 4s^1$$ instead of the expected $$3d^4 4s^2$$).

      "explanation": "<p>To determine the correct order of the second ionization potentials for carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), and fluorine (F), we need to consider how the removal of the second electron affects the electronic structure of each element's ion.</p>\n\n<p>Ionization potential (IP) is the energy required to remove an electron from a gaseous atom or ion. The second ionization potential specifically refers to the energy needed to remove a second electron after the first has already been removed. Generally, the second ionization potential is higher than the first because the remaining electrons experience a higher effective nuclear charge after one electron is removed.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s consider the electronic configurations of the singly ionized ions of these elements:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>$$C^+: 1s^2 2s^2 2p^1$$</li>\n\n<li>$$N^+: 1s^2 2s^2 2p^2$$</li>\n\n<li>$$O^+: 1s^2 2s^2 2p^3$$</li>\n\n<li>$$F^+: 1s^2 2s^2 2p^4$$</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Second ionization potential will involve removing an electron from the configurations as shown above. Here are some considerations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Removing a second electron from a half-filled or fully filled p-orbital (as in $$N^+$$ and $$F^+$$) requires more energy because of the increased stability of half-filled and fully filled configurations.</li>\n\n<li>In the case of $$O^+$$, removing one electron from the 2p orbitals will lead to a half-filled stable configuration (similar to $$N$$), which will make this ion less stable than $$N^+$$ initially, hence requiring lesser energy to remove an electron compared to $$N^+$$.</li>\n\n<li>$$C^+$$, having only one electron in the 2p orbitals, will have the least stable arrangement among these; hence it will likely have the lowest second ionization potential.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Based on these considerations:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>$$F^+$$, having to remove an electron from a near half-filled p-orbital (2p4 to 2p3), will involve high energy.</li>\n\n<li>$$N^+$$, with a half-filled p-orbital configuration, will have a next higher second ionization potential.</li>\n\n<li>$$O^+$$, removal leads to a half-filled configuration which is energetically favorable, thus requiring less energy compared to $$N^+$$.</li>\n\n<li>$$C^+$$ will require the least energy to remove the second electron.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thus, the correct order of increasing second ionization potential is:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option C:</strong> $$C &gt; O &gt; N &gt; F.$$</p>\n\n<p>This suggests that carbon will require the lowest energy to lose its second electron, followed by oxygen, then nitrogen, and fluorine needing the highest energy to lose its second electron among these elements.</p>"
