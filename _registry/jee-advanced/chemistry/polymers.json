      "explanation": "<p>Natural rubber is an elastomer in which the chains are held together by weak van der Waals forces of attraction. Cellulose and nylon are fibres and PVC is a thermoplastic. Both these classes of polymers have stronger forces of attraction in the order</p>\n<p>Fibre > Thermoplastic > Elastomer.</p>"
