This means that red and green will not overlap perfectly.</p></p>\n\n<p><p><strong>Color Overlap</strong>: As the fringe patterns develop, some regions will have overlap due to the differing fringe spacings of red and green light. This overlap will create areas where the colors mix, potentially leading to an appearance of intermediate colors.</p></p>\n\n<p>Overall, because each color produces its own pattern and these do not align, a clear interference pattern as seen with monochromatic light (a single color) will not be formed. Instead, there will be a complex pattern where the fringes do not distinctly appear as solid bands of red or green due to the overlapping and different fringe widths.</p>"

      "explanation": "<p>The correct answer is Option A: Both Statement I and Statement II are true.</p>\n\n<p>Explanation:</p>\n\n<p>Statement I discusses the dispersion of white light through a prism, which is a phenomenon where white light splits into its component colors when passed through a prism. This happens because different colors (or wavelengths) of light bend (refract) by different amounts upon passing through a prism. Red light bends the least while violet bends the most, with yellow falling somewhere in between. This is why the statement, \"When the white light passed through a prism, the red light bends lesser than yellow and violet,\" is true.</p>\n\n<p>Statement II addresses the underlying cause of the dispersion of light, which is that the refractive index of a medium varies with wavelength (or color) of light. This property of the medium is known as dispersion. A refractive index determines how much light bends when entering a medium. Since the refractive index varies with the wavelength, different colors of light bend by different amounts when they pass through a dispersive medium like a glass prism. This is why violet light bends more than red light - because the refractive index for violet light is higher than that for red light in glass. Therefore, the statement, \"The refractive indices are different for different wavelengths in dispersive medium,\" is also true.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, both statements I and II accurately describe the principles behind the phenomenon of light dispersion through a prism, making Option A the correct choice.</p>"

      "explanation": "<p>Statement - 1 : When light reflects from the air-glass plate interface, the reflected wave suffers a phase change of π.</p>\n<p>This statement is true. According to the physics of wave optics, when light reflects from a denser medium (glass in this case) to a rarer medium (air), there is a phase change of π (or 180 degrees).</p>\n<p>Statement - 2 : The center of the interference pattern is dark.</p>\n<p>This statement is also true. When a thin air film is formed between a convex lens and a plane surface, the path difference at the center of the pattern is zero. However, due to the phase change of π at the lower surface (glass surface), the two interfering waves are out of phase at the center, resulting in destructive interference and creating a dark spot at the center.</p>\n<p>So both statements are true. However, statement - 2 is not a direct explanation of statement - 1. Statement - 2 arises because of the combination of the path difference and the phase change mentioned in statement - 1, but it doesn&#39;t directly explain why the phase change occurs.</p>\n<p>Hence, the answer is :</p>\n<p>Option B : Statement - 1 is true, Statement - 2 is true, Statement - 2 is not the correct explanation of Statement - 1.</p>"
