The general formula for gravitational acceleration at a height $h$ above the surface is: $$ g_h = \\frac{g}{{\\left(1 + \\frac{h}{R}\\right)}^2} $$ Plugging $h = 2R$ into the formula, we get:\n\n<p>$$ g_h = \\frac{g}{{(1 + \\frac{2R}{R})}^2} $$</p>\n\n<p>$$ g_h = \\frac{g}{{(1 + 2)}^2} $$</p>\n\n<p>$$ g_h = \\frac{g}{3^2} = \\frac{g}{9} $$ </p></p>\n\n<p>So the gravitational acceleration at height $h$ is one-ninth of the gravitational acceleration at the surface of the Earth. Given that $g = \\pi^2 \\text{ m/s}^2$, we get: $$ g_h = \\frac{\\pi^2}{9} \\text{ m/s}^2 $$ </p>\n\n<p>Now knowing the gravitational acceleration at height $h$ and with the period $T$ of 2 seconds, we can rearrange the formula for the second's pendulum to solve for the length $L_h$:\n\n<p>$$ 2 = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{L_h}{g_h}} $$ \n<br/><br/>$$ 1 = \\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{L_h}{g_h}} $$ \n<br/><br/>$$ \\frac{1}{\\pi} = \\sqrt{\\frac{L_h}{g_h}} $$\n<br/><br/> Squaring both sides, we get:</p>\n\n<p>$$ \\frac{1}{\\pi^2} = \\frac{L_h}{g_h} $$\n<br/><br/> Multiplying both sides by $g_h$ gives us the length $L_h$:</p>\n\n<p>$$ L_h = \\frac{g_h}{\\pi^2} $$ </p></p>\n\n<p>Substituting $g_h$ into the equation yields:\n\n<p>$$ L_h = \\frac{\\pi^2}{9\\pi^2} $$</p>\n\n<p>$$ L_h = \\frac{1}{9} \\text{ m} $$ </p></p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the length of the second's pendulum at a height $h = 2R$ from the surface of the Earth is $\\frac{1}{9}$ meters.

This acceleration decreases as we move away from the Earth&#39;s surface because gravity is a force that attracts objects towards the center of the Earth. This force decreases with the square of the distance from the center of the Earth, due to the inverse square law.</p>\n<p>However, if we are at a height ($h$) much less than the radius of the Earth ($R$), we can use a linear approximation to calculate the new acceleration due to gravity ($g&#39;$) at this height. This is because for small heights compared to the radius of Earth, the decrease in $g$ can be approximated to be linear.
