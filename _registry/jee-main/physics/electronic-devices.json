      "explanation": "A p-n junction consists of a p-type semiconductor (which has an excess of holes) in contact with an n-type semiconductor (which has an excess of electrons). In a forward-biased p-n junction, an external voltage is applied such that the positive terminal is connected to the p-side and the negative terminal is connected to the n-side. This configuration promotes the flow of majority charge carriers (holes from the p-side and electrons from the n-side) across the junction.\n<br/><br/>\nThere are two types of currents in a p-n junction: drift current and diffusion current. Drift current is caused by the electric field due to the built-in potential, which opposes the flow of majority charge carriers. Diffusion current is caused by the concentration gradient of the charge carriers, which promotes the flow of majority charge carriers.\n<br/><br/>\nWhen the p-n junction is forward biased, the applied voltage reduces the potential barrier, allowing more majority charge carriers to flow across the junction. This results in an increase in the diffusion current. In a forward-biased p-n junction, the diffusion current is indeed greater than the drift current in magnitude, so <b>Assertion A</b> is correct.\n<br/><br/>\nRegarding <b>Reason R</b>: The diffusion current in a p-n junction is actually from the p-side to the n-side, as holes (majority charge carriers in the p-side) move from the p-side to the n-side, and electrons (majority charge carriers in the n-side) move from the n-side to the p-side. Therefore, Reason R is incorrect."

When a Zener diode is reverse-biased, it operates in the breakdown region, where a relatively constant voltage is maintained across the diode, regardless of the current flowing through it. This property makes it useful as a voltage regulator. In forward bias, the voltage applied across the diode is in the same direction as the normal direction of current flow. In this condition, the Zener diode behaves like a simple pn junction diode and allows current to flow in the forward direction."
