The reason provided is that the electric field inside a cavity enclosed by a conductor is zero. </p>\n<p>This reasoning is based on the property of metallic conductors, where the electric field within a conductor's cavity is indeed zero. This phenomenon occurs because the charges on a conductor redistribute themselves to cancel any external electric fields within the conductor. Thus, if lightning were to strike an aircraft, the metal body would direct the electric charges along its surface, effectively shielding the interior where passengers are located. </p>\n<p>Therefore, the assertion and the reason are both correct, and the reason correctly explains why the metal body of an aircraft shields passengers from lightning. This aligns with the principles of electromagnetic shielding.

As vehicles move through the air, especially at high speeds, friction between the air and the vehicle can lead to the accumulation of static electricity on the vehicle. This is a common phenomenon and is more pronounced in dry conditions where humidity is low, as moisture in the air can help dissipate static charge more effectively.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of vehicles carrying inflammable fluids, the presence of static electricity poses a significant risk. This is because a static discharge (or sparking) in the presence of flammable vapors can ignite those vapors, leading to potentially catastrophic fires or explosions. The metallic chains that touch the ground serve a crucial safety function by providing a path for the static electrical charge to safely dissipate into the earth, a process known as grounding. The earth acts as a vast reservoir that can absorb large amounts of electrical charge. By grounding the vehicle in this way, the risk of static discharge into the surrounding atmosphere is significantly reduced, enhancing safety by preventing ignition of inflammable materials.</p>\n\n<p>The effectiveness of this safety measure hinges on the electrical conductivity of the chain and its contact with the ground. The chain must be made of a material with good electrical conductivity (such as metal) and maintain adequate contact with the ground to ensure that the static charge can be continuously dissipated. This safety precaution is a practical application of electrostatic principles, showcasing how understanding and harnessing the laws of physics can provide effective solutions to real-world problems.</p>"

      "explanation": "<p>When considering the electric flux linked with a cube due to a charge placed at one of its surfaces, it's important to apply Gauss's law. Gauss's law states that the total electric flux through a closed surface is equal to $$\\frac{q_{\\text{enc}}}{\\epsilon_0}$$, where $$q_{\\text{enc}}$$ is the charge enclosed by the surface and $$\\epsilon_0$$ is the permittivity of free space.</p>\n\n<p>In the given scenario, the charge $$q$$ is placed at the center of one of the surfaces of the cube. Conceptually, we can think of this arrangement as part of a larger situation where if we had a larger, imaginary cube that encompasses the entire setup such that the point charge is at its geometric center, the charge would then be uniformly distributing its flux through all six faces of this larger cube. However, since the actual setup involves only one cube with one face adjacent to the charge, we essentially have only one-half of the total possible geometry through which the flux from this charge can emerge - implying the flux through our actual cube is a fraction of the total flux that would emanate from the charge if it were centrally placed within a larger, encompassing cube.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, only half of the flux emanating from the charge will pass through the actual cube because the charge is placed directly on one of its surfaces, effectively distributing its influence through 180 degrees (half of the space around it) instead of the full 360 degrees. Hence, the flux linked with the cube will be half of the total flux $$\\frac{q}{\\epsilon_0}$$, which is calculated using Gauss's law for a point charge.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the correct answer is $$\\frac{q}{2\\epsilon_0}$$.</p>\n\n<p>Option A $$\\frac{q}{2 \\epsilon_0}$$ is the correct choice.</p>"

This statement is true because by definition, an equipotential surface is a surface over which the electric potential is constant. When a charge moves along an equipotential surface, there is no change in its electric potential energy since potential difference $$ \\Delta V $$ is zero. Work done ($$ W $$) is defined as the product of charge ($$ q $$), potential difference ($$ \\Delta V $$), and the cosine of the angle between the field and direction of motion ($$ \\cos \\theta $$), which can be written as:</p>\n<p>$$ W = q \\Delta V \\cos \\theta $$</p>\n<p>Because $$ \\Delta V = 0 $$ on an equipotential surface, irrespective of the value of $$ \\cos \\theta $$, the work $$ W $$ will be zero. Hence, the Assertion (A) is correct.</p>\n<p>Reason (R) says that electric lines of forces are always perpendicular to equipotential surfaces. This statement is also correct as the electric field lines, by definition, are directed such that they are tangent to the electric field vector at any point in space. Since the electric potential is constant on an equipotential surface, there can be no component of the electric field parallel to the surface, as that would imply a force and potential change along the surface. The electric field thus must be perpendicular to the equipotential surface, which means that the electric field lines must also be perpendicular to the equipotential surface. In other words, the electric field does no work when a charge moves along an equipotential surface because the motion is perpendicular to the force.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Reason (R) is not only correct, but it is also the correct explanation for Assertion (A), making Option A the right choice.</p>\n"

According to Gauss's Law, the electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the net charge enclosed by the surface. Since an electric dipole consists of two equal and opposite charges, the net charge enclosed by the surface is zero, and therefore, the net flux coming out of the surface will also be zero.\n<br/><br/>\nReason R: Electric dipole consists of two equal and opposite charges.<br/><br/>\nThis statement is also true. An electric dipole is formed by two equal and opposite charges separated by a fixed distance.\n<br/><br/>\nThe reason R correctly explains the assertion A because the net charge enclosed by the surface is zero due to the presence of equal and opposite charges in the electric dipole, resulting in zero net electric flux coming out of the surface."

The potential due to a point charge is given by the Coulomb's law, which is non-zero except at the location of the charge itself. Therefore, the net potential due to a group of positive charges can never be zero at a point.\n\n<br/><br/>On the other hand, the net electric field at a point is the vector sum of the electric fields due to each individual charge. If the charges are arranged in such a way that their electric fields cancel out at a particular point, then the net electric field at that point can be zero, even though the charges are present. This can happen, for example, in a symmetrical arrangement of charges.\n\n<br/><br/>So, statement (A) is the correct statement."

First, let's find $$\\overrightarrow{\\mathrm{E}} \\cdot \\hat{n}$$:</p>\n<p>$$\\overrightarrow{\\mathrm{E}} \\cdot \\hat{n} = \\left(\\frac{2 \\hat{i}+6 \\hat{j}+8 \\hat{k}}{\\sqrt{6}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2 \\hat{i}+\\hat{j}+\\hat{k}}{\\sqrt{6}}\\right)$$</p>\n<p>To compute the dot product, we multiply corresponding components and then add them up:</p>\n<p>$$\\left(\\frac{2 \\hat{i}+6 \\hat{j}+8 \\hat{k}}{\\sqrt{6}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2 \\hat{i}+\\hat{j}+\\hat{k}}{\\sqrt{6}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{6}(2\\cdot2 + 6\\cdot1 + 8\\cdot1)$$</p>\n<p>$$= \\frac{1}{6}(4 + 6 + 8) = \\frac{18}{6} = 3$$</p>\n<p>Then, the electric flux through the surface is:</p>\n<p>$$\\Phi = (\\overrightarrow{\\mathrm{E}} \\cdot \\hat{n})A = 3 \\times 4 \\mathrm{m}^2$$</p>\n<p>$$\\Phi = 12 \\mathrm{Vm}$$</p>\n<p>So, the electric flux for that surface is $$12 \\mathrm{Vm}$$.</p>"

      "explanation": "<p>Given three concentric spherical shells X, Y, and Z with radii a, b, and c respectively, and with surface charge densities ( $\\sigma$ ), ( $-\\sigma$ ), and ( $\\sigma$ ) respectively, we know that the potential at the surface of a sphere due to a uniform surface charge is given by:</p>\n<p>$ V = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{Q}{r} $</p>\n<p>where ( $\\epsilon_0$ ) is the permittivity of free space, ( Q ) is the total charge on the sphere, and ( r ) is the radius of the sphere.</p>\n<p>However, in this case, the total charge on each sphere is given by its surface charge density ( $\\sigma$ ) times its surface area ( $4\\pi r^2$ ). Substituting this into the formula for ( Q ) gives:</p>\n<p>$ Q = \\sigma 4\\pi r^2 $</p>\n<p>So the potential at the surface of each sphere is given by:</p>\n<p>$ V = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{\\sigma 4\\pi r^2}{r} = \\frac{\\sigma r}{\\epsilon_0} $</p>\n<p>We are given that the potential at X and Z are the same.
