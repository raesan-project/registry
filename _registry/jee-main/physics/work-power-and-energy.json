For conservative forces, you can define a potential energy function. Examples include Coulomb’s force, gravitational force, and the restoring force of a spring.</p></p>\n<p><p><strong>Non-Conservative Forces:</strong> These forces depend on the path taken and usually result in energy dissipation (often as heat). Friction is a typical example, and hence, it cannot be described solely by a potential energy function.</p></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Example Explanations:</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><p><strong>Coulomb’s Force:</strong> It is a conservative force because the work done in moving a charge in an electric field only depends on the difference in electric potential between two points.</p></p>\n<p><p><strong>Gravitational Force:</strong> It is also conservative. The potential energy associated with gravitational force is given by gravitational potential energy, for example, $$U = mgh$$ near the Earth’s surface.</p></p>\n<p><p><strong>Restoring Force:</strong> For a spring, the force is given by Hooke’s law: $$F = -kx$$ and the corresponding potential energy is $$U = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2.$$ This is a conservative force.</p></p>\n\n<p>Since friction is a non-conservative force that dissipates energy, it cannot be expressed in terms of potential energy.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: Frictional force.</p>"

If a truck and a car are moving with the same kinetic energy and are brought to rest by applying brakes that provide equal retarding forces, both will come to rest in equal distances. This is because the distance required to stop an object depends on its initial kinetic energy and the force applied to bring it to rest.

When the car moves from east to north, even though its speed remains unchanged, its direction changes. Since velocity is a vector quantity that has both magnitude (speed) and direction, a change in direction implies a change in velocity. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, so when the velocity changes, there is acceleration. In this case, the car's acceleration is not zero as it turns from east to north."
