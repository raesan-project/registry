According to physics, particularly when dealing with electromagnetism and Maxwell's equations, the momentum of the electromagnetic field plays a critical role in conserving momentum in systems where electromagnetic forces are at play. In situations where electric and magnetic fields vary with time, they can carry momentum. Thus, for the conservation laws to hold, including Newton's third law which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, the momentum carried by the electromagnetic fields must be included. This is essential in scenarios such as radiation pressure where light (which can be considered an electromagnetic wave) exerts pressure on surfaces, thereby imparting momentum.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Statement (II) :</strong> \"Ampere's circuital law does not depend on Biot-Savart's law.\" This statement is false. Historically and mathematically, Ampère's Circuital Law and Biot-Savart Law are closely related in the context of classical electromagnetism. Ampère's Law, particularly in its integral form, relates the integrated magnetic field around a closed loop to the electric current passing through the loop. Biot-Savart Law, on the other hand, is used to calculate the magnetic field generated by a current-carrying element at a point in space. Although Ampère's Law can be derived without directly invoking the Biot-Savart Law, the fundamental understanding and derivations of magnetic fields due to currents, as presented in many textbooks and formulations, show that both laws are manifestations of how moving charges produce magnetic fields. Moreover, the formulation of Ampère's Law was later extended by Maxwell (Maxwell's addition) to include the concept of displacement current, linking it more fundamentally to the changing electric fields and closing a conceptual loop that ties it to the broader electromagnetic theory that includes the effects described by the Biot-Savart Law.</p>\n\n<p>Given the above explanations:</p>\n<p>Option D (Statement I is true but Statement II is false) is the correct answer.</p>"

The principle to consider here is Ampère's law, which states that the magnetic field in a loop surrounding a current is proportional to the amount of current enclosed. When we apply this to a coaxial cable, we must look at different regions within the cable.</p>\n\n<p>Option A: Inside the outer conductor</p>\n\n<p>The magnetic field within the outer conductor is not zero because the current in the outer conductor itself contributes to the magnetic field in that region. However, considering the symmetric distribution of current and the geometry of the coaxial cable, there may be a varying magnetic field within the conductor depending on the distance from the center axis.</p>\n\n<p>Option B: Outside the cable</p>\n\n<p>Outside the coaxial cable, the net current enclosed by a path enclosing both conductors is zero because the current in the inner conductor flows in the opposite direction to the equally magnitude current in the outer conductor. These currents being equal and opposite in direction cancel each other out, leading to a net enclosed current of zero. According to Ampère's law, if the net enclosed current is zero, the magnetic field in that space is also zero. Therefore, the magnetic field is zero outside the cable.</p>\n\n<p>Option C: In between the two conductors</p>\n\n<p>In the space between the two conductors, the magnetic field is not zero. This region only encloses the current from the inner conductor. The magnetic field in this region is due to the current in the inner conductor and follows the right-hand rule, which would result in concentric circles of magnetic field around the inner conductor. Since only the inner conductor's current contributes to the magnetic field in this space, Ampère's law suggests that there is a non-zero magnetic field in this region.</p>\n\n<p>Option D: Inside the inner conductor</p>\n\n<p>Within the inner conductor, the magnetic field is not necessarily zero. Like within the outer conductor, the magnetic field inside the inner conductor will depend on the distribution of the current within that conductor. Utilizing the formula derived from Ampère's law for a cylindrical conductor with a uniform current distribution, the magnetic field inside the conductor increases linearly with the distance from the center axis up to the conductor's surface.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, the correct option, based on Ampère's law and the principle that the net current enclosed determines the magnetic field outside the current's path, is:</p>\n\n<p>Option B: Outside the cable</p>\n\n<p>This is because the equal and opposite currents in the inner and outer conductors cancel each other, leading to a net magnetic field of zero outside the coaxial cable.</p>"

      "explanation": "<p>For this scenario, it's important to recall how magnetic fields influence the motion of charged particles, and the configuration of the magnetic field within a solenoid. Inside a long solenoid, the magnetic field lines run parallel to the axis of the solenoid. The strength of this field is uniform and depends on the current running through the solenoid's coils and the number of turns per unit length but is independent of the position inside the solenoid as long as one is sufficiently far from the ends. </p>\n\n<p>The force experienced by a charged particle moving in a magnetic field is given by the Lorentz force equation: $$\\vec{F} = q(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})$$ where\n\n<ul>\n<li>$$q$$ is the charge of the particle,</li><br>\n<li>$$\\vec{v}$$ is the velocity of the particle, and</li><br>\n<li>$$\\vec{B}$$ is the magnetic field.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For an electron moving along the axis inside a solenoid:\n\n<ul>\n<li>The magnetic field ($$\\vec{B}$$) inside the solenoid is parallel to the axis of the solenoid.</li><br>\n<li>The velocity of the electron ($$\\vec{v}$$) is also parallel to the axis of the solenoid and hence parallel to $$\\vec{B}$$. </p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since the cross product of two parallel vectors (in this case, $$\\vec{v}$$ and $$\\vec{B}$$) is zero, the Lorentz force ($$\\vec{F} = q(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})$$) acting on the electron will be zero. Therefore, the electron will not experience any force due to the magnetic field of the solenoid, as there is no component of its velocity that is perpendicular to the magnetic field within the solenoid.</p>\n\n<p>Given the above explanation, the correct option is:</p>\n\n<p>Option D: the electron will continue to move with uniform velocity along the axis of the solenoid.</p>\n\n<p>This is because, in the absence of any force acting on it, the electron will maintain its state of motion according to Newton's first law of motion, which states that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.</p>"
