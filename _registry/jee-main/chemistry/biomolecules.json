This statement is <strong>correct</strong>. Glucose exists in equilibrium with various isomeric forms in solution, including its linear form and two cyclic forms (alpha and beta anomers) that result from the formation of a hemiacetal bond within the molecule itself. The interconversion between these forms is known as mutarotation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option B:</strong> Glucose is soluble in water because of having an aldehyde functional group. This statement is <strong>incorrect</strong> though it might seem partially true at first glance. While the aldehyde group can participate in hydrogen bonding, the primary reason glucose is highly soluble in water is due to its multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups that can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. The ability to form numerous hydrogen bonds makes glucose highly water-soluble, not just the presence of an aldehyde group.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option C:</strong> Glucose is an aldohexose. This statement is <strong>correct</strong>. Glucose is classified as an aldohexose because it contains an aldehyde group (-CHO) on its first carbon and has a total of six carbon atoms, making it a hexose sugar.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option D:</strong> Glucose is one of the monomer units in sucrose. This statement is <strong>correct</strong>. Sucrose is a disaccharide composed of two monomers: glucose and fructose. Thus, glucose is indeed one of the monomer units in sucrose.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, the <strong>incorrect</strong> statement about glucose is <strong>Option B</strong>: Glucose is soluble in water because of having an aldehyde functional group. The primary reason for its solubility in water is the hydroxyl groups' ability to form extensive hydrogen bonding, not solely the presence of an aldehyde functional group.</p>"

      "explanation": "<p>The correct answer is Option A: (B) and (D).</p>\n<p>Let’s analyze each statement:</p>\n<p>(A) Enzymes are biocatalysts. - This statement is correct. Enzymes are indeed biocatalysts, meaning they are natural catalytic substances produced by living organisms to speed up chemical reactions in cells without being consumed in the process. They are crucial for a myriad of biological processes.</p>\n<p>(B) Enzymes are non-specific and can catalyse different kinds of reactions. - This statement is incorrect. Enzymes are highly specific in nature; they typically catalyze only one kind of reaction or a very limited range of reactions. This specificity is a result of the unique 3D structure of the enzyme molecule, particularly the active site where substrate molecules bind.</p>\n<p>(C) Most enzymes are globular proteins. - This statement is correct. The vast majority of enzymes are indeed globular proteins. This means they are folded into a compact shape which is crucial for their function. Their globular structure allows for the creation of specific active sites where the chemical reactions take place.</p>\n<p>(D) Enzyme - oxidase catalyses the hydrolysis of maltose into glucose. - This statement is incorrect. The enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of maltose into glucose is maltase, not oxidase. Oxidases are a class of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of electrons to oxygen, and are involved in oxidation reactions, not in the hydrolysis of sugars.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the incorrect statements regarding enzymes are (B) Enzymes are non-specific and can catalyse different kinds of reactions, and (D) Enzyme - oxidase catalyses the hydrolysis of maltose into glucose, making Option A the correct choice.</p>"

      "explanation": "<p>The coagulation of an egg on heating is because of <strong>Option A: Denaturation of protein occurs</strong>. When an egg is heated, the proteins in the egg (primarily albumins) undergo denaturation. This process involves the structural alteration of the protein molecules without breaking the peptide bonds that hold the amino acid sequences together. Denaturation causes the proteins to unfold and then aggregate into a new, solid structure, which is what you observe as the egg white and yolk changing from liquid to solid. This change is principally caused by the disruption of non-covalent bonds in the protein, such as hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and hydrophobic interactions.</p>\n\n<p>Option B is incorrect because the biological property of the protein does indeed change during the process. The protein in its denatured (coagulated) form does not function in the same way as it did in its native form.</p>\n\n<p>Option C is also incorrect because the primary structure of the protein, defined by its amino acid sequence linked by peptide bonds, remains unaltered during denaturation. The process does not involve the breaking of these peptide linkages.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, Option D is incorrect because the secondary structure of the protein, which includes α-helices and β-pleated sheets formed by hydrogen bonding, typically undergoes significant alteration during denaturation, contributing to the observable change in the egg's texture.</p>"

This reaction primarily occurs due to the reaction of ninhydrin with the free amino groups (-NH<sub>2</sub>) present in amino acids or proteins.</p>\n\n<p>Let's examine each option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option A: Polyvinyl chloride</strong> - Polyvinyl chloride, commonly known as PVC, is a synthetic polymer. It does not contain amino acids or free amino groups. Therefore, it does not give a positive test with ninhydrin.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option B: Cellulose</strong> - Cellulose is a carbohydrate polymer consisting of glucose units. It is the main constituent of the cell wall in plants. Like PVC, cellulose does not contain amino acids or free amino groups, so it also does not give a positive test with ninhydrin.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option C: Egg albumin</strong> - Egg albumin is a protein found in egg whites. Proteins are made up of amino acids linked by peptide bonds, and free amino groups are present in the structure of proteins. Therefore, egg albumin reacts with ninhydrin and gives a positive test by producing a deep blue or purple color.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option D: Starch</strong> - Starch is a polysaccharide composed of glucose units and is a carbohydrate like cellulose. It does not possess amino acids or free amino groups. Consequently, starch does not give a positive test with ninhydrin.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the explanation, the correct answer is <strong>Option C: Egg albumin</strong>, as it is the only option among the ones listed that contains proteins, which have free amino groups capable of reacting with ninhydrin to give a positive test.</p>"

      "explanation": "Among the given options, arginine, histidine, and lysine are all basic amino acids because they contain amino (-NH<sub>2</sub>) and imino (-NH=) functional groups that can accept a proton (H<sup>+</sup>) to become positively charged. \n<br/><br/>\nAsparagine, on the other hand, contains an amide (-CONH<sub>2</sub>) functional group instead of an imino group. This functional group is not basic because it does not have a proton that can be easily removed. Therefore, the answer is:  asparagine."

Glucose - is a reducing sugar, as it has a free aldehyde group.\n<br/><br/>2. Maltose - is a reducing sugar. It has a free anomeric carbon that can form an aldehyde group.\n<br/><br/>3. Sucrose - is not a reducing sugar. Its glycosidic bond locks the anomeric carbons, preventing them from forming an aldehyde or ketone.\n<br/><br/>4. Ribose - is a reducing sugar, as it has an aldehyde group.\n<br/><br/>5. 2-deoxyribose - is a reducing sugar. It has a free anomeric carbon that can form an aldehyde group.\n<br/><br/>6. Amylose - is a polysaccharide and does not typically behave as a reducing sugar in Benedict's test. Even though one end of the amylose chain can technically open to reveal an aldehyde group (the so-called reducing end), the reaction would likely be much less dramatic than with true reducing sugars, and might not occur at all under typical test conditions.\n<br/><br/>7. Lactose - is a reducing sugar, as it has a free anomeric carbon that can form an aldehyde group.\n\n<br/><br/>Hence, out of the seven compounds listed, sucrose and amylose will not likely produce an orange-red precipitate with Benedict's solution. Thus, the number of compounds that will not produce an orange-red precipitate with Benedict's solution is 2."
