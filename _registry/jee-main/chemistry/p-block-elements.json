This trend is primarily due to the increase in the size of the central atom as we move down the group, leading to weaker bonds between the central atom and hydrogen in the hydride.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Option A</strong> is the correct answer. Both Statement I and Statement II are false.</p>\n<p>Noble gases actually have <strong>low boiling points</strong>, not high. This is because noble gases are indeed monoatomic gases that exist as single atoms. They have a completely filled valence shell and do not easily form chemical bonds with other atoms. As a result, the intermolecular forces present in noble gases are only <strong>temporary dipole-induced dipole attractions</strong>, also known as <strong>dispersion forces (or London forces)</strong>. However, these dispersion forces are very weak compared to other types of intermolecular forces like hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole interactions that occur in other substances.</p>\n<p>The dispersion forces in noble gases are weak because these gases are non-polar and since they are monoatomic, the electron cloud around the atom is symmetrical, meaning that there are no permanent dipoles within the molecules. As the atomic size of noble gases increases down the group, the dispersion forces do increase in strength due to the larger electron cloud that can be more easily distorted, resulting in higher boiling points for the heavier noble gases. Still, compared to other substances, the overall strength of the dispersion forces in noble gases is low, which means they can be liquefied at low temperatures and hence their boiling points are low, not high.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the correct statement would be: \"Noble gases are monoatomic gases. They are held together by weak dispersion forces. Because of this they are liquefied at very low temperatures. Hence, they have very low boiling points.\"</p>"

So, this statement is correct.\n<br/><br/>\nOption B : It is a cyclic compound.\nBorazine has a hexagonal ring structure, making it a cyclic compound. So, this statement is correct.\n<br/><br/>\nOption C : It has electronic delocalization.\nThe electrons in the boron-nitrogen double bonds are delocalized over the entire ring, similar to benzene. So, this statement is correct.\n<br/><br/>\nOption D : It contains banana bonds.\nBanana bonds are typically used to describe the unconventional, multicenter bonding in certain clusters or molecules, such as diborane (B₂H₆). Borazine does not contain banana bonds; it has a planar hexagonal structure with alternating single and double bonds between boron and nitrogen atoms. So, this statement is incorrect.\n<br/><br/>\nThus, the incorrect statement for borazine is : It contains banana bonds."

If the charge on the cation increases or if the size of the cation decreases, the covalent character increases. </p>\n<p>In the case of SbCl₅ and SbCl₃, the antimony (Sb) cation in SbCl₅ has a higher charge due to the greater number of chlorine (Cl) atoms, thus increasing the polarization and making SbCl₅ more covalent than SbCl₃.</p>\n<p>Statement II : The higher oxides of halogens also tend to be more stable than the lower ones.</p>\n<p>This statement is also correct.

The +4 oxidation state means that sulfur has lost 4 electrons compared to its elemental state.</p>\n\n<p>Let's go through each compound:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$$\\mathrm{SO}_3$$: Sulfur trioxide. In this compound, sulfur exhibits a +6 oxidation state because each oxygen contributes -2, for a total of -6 (3 oxygens), which must be balanced by sulfur to maintain a neutral charge. So, this compound does not have sulfur in the +4 oxidation state. </li>\n\n<br/><li>$$\\mathrm{H}_2 \\mathrm{SO}_3$$: Sulfurous acid. Here again, with two hydrogens (each contributing +1 = total +2) and three oxygens (each contributing -2 = total -6), sulfur has an oxidation state of +4 to balance out the -4 from the oxygens and +2 from the hydrogens. This compound does have sulfur in the +4 oxidation state.</li>\n\n<br/><li>$$\\mathrm{SOCl}_2$$: Thionyl chloride. Sulfur in this compound is connected to two chlorine atoms and one oxygen atom. Chlorine generally has an oxidation state of -1 (total -2 for both Cl atoms) and oxygen -2. To balance the -4 charge (from one oxygen and two chlorines), sulfur must have an oxidation state of +4. This compound has sulfur in the +4 oxidation state.</li>\n\n<br/><li>$$\\mathrm{SF}_4$$: Sulfur tetrafluoride. Fluorine is almost always in the -1 oxidation state, and there are four fluorine atoms for a total of -4. To balance this, sulfur must have a +4 oxidation state, making this compound one with sulfur in the +4 oxidation state.</li>\n\n<br/><li>$$\\mathrm{BaSO}_4$$: Barium sulfate. Barium has a +2 oxidation state, and sulfate (SO4) as a whole must have a -2 oxidation state to balance the barium. In sulfate, sulfur has an oxidation state of +6 (since each oxygen is -2 for a total of -8, and +6 from sulfur balances it to -2 overall). Hence, sulfur does not have a +4 oxidation state in this compound.</li>\n\n<br/><li>$$\\mathrm{H}_2 \\mathrm{S}_2 \\mathrm{O}_7$$: Pyrosulfuric acid or oleum. Each hydrogen is +1 (total +2), and the seven oxygens are -2 each (total -14). To balance -12 (total of oxygens and hydrogens), each sulfur must have an oxidation state of +6. Therefore, sulfur is not in the +4 oxidation state in this molecule.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, from the given list, only three compounds have sulfur in the +4 oxidation state: $$\\mathrm{H}_2 \\mathrm{SO}_3$$, $$\\mathrm{SOCl}_2$$, and $$\\mathrm{SF}_4$$. Therefore, the number of compounds with a +4 oxidation state of sulfur is three.</p>"
