Cis and trans isomers of 2-butene are not readily interconvertible at room temperature due to the energy barrier associated with the rotation around the double bond. The double bond ensures rigidity, making interconversion between these isomers difficult without sufficient energy input.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option B:</strong> \"Trans-2-butene is more stable than cis-2-butene.\"</p>\n\n<p>This statement is correct. The trans isomer is more stable than the cis isomer due to reduced steric hindrance.

The cis isomer typically has a higher dipole moment than the trans isomer because the substituents on the same side of the double bond create a net dipole moment.

The electromeric effect involves the transfer of electron pairs within a molecule in the presence of an attacking reagent. There are two types of electromeric effects: the positive electromeric effect ($$E^+$$) and the negative electromeric effect ($$E^-$$). A positive electromeric effect occurs when electrons are transferred towards the reagent, while a negative electromeric effect occurs when electrons are transferred away from the reagent.</p>\n\n<p>Since a hydrogen ion $$(\\mathrm{H}^{+})$$ is an electron-deficient species (it lacks electrons), it would generally induce the transfer of electrons towards itself, resulting in a positive electromeric effect.

This is when a bond between two atoms breaks and both electrons of the shared pair go to one of the atoms, creating ions. One atom becomes a positively charged ion (cation), as it loses an electron, and the other becomes a negatively charged ion (anion), as it gains an electron.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, <b>homolytic bond cleavage</b> occurs when each atom gets one electron from the shared pair, leading to the formation of two free radicals, which are highly reactive species with unpaired electrons. However, this is not typically how ionic reactions proceed in organic compounds.</p>\n\n<p>The options (C), (D), and (E) mention free radicals. Since homolytic cleavage leads to free radicals, and we've established that ionic reactions in organic chemistry generally proceed through heterolytic cleavage, free radicals are not typically involved in these reactions.

      "explanation": "<p>The purification method among the ones listed that is based on the principle of \"Solubility\" in two different solvents is Option D, Differential Extraction.</p>\n\n<p>Differential extraction, also known as liquid-liquid extraction or solvent extraction, is a technique to separate compounds based on their relative solubilities in two different immiscible liquids, usually water and an organic solvent. It exploits the fact that the compound of interest has different solubility properties in two solvents which are not miscible with each other. A solution containing the desired compound and impurities is mixed with a second solvent in which the desired compound is more soluble. The two solvents form layers due to their immiscibility, and the compound partitions into the layer where it is more soluble. By separating the layers and repeating the process if necessary, a higher degree of purification can be achieved for the target compound.</p>\n\n<p>Let's quickly review why the other options do not primarily use solubility in two different solvents:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Distillation (Option A):</strong> Distillation is a process that separates the components of a mixture based on differences in their boiling points. It does not rely on differential solubility in two solvents.</li>\n<br/><li><strong>Sublimation (Option B):</strong> Sublimation is the phase transition of a substance from the solid to the gas phase without passing through the intermediate liquid phase. This process is based on the volatility of the substance, not on its solubility in solvents.</li>\n<br/><li><strong>Column Chromatography (Option C):</strong> Column chromatography separates compounds based on their differing affinities to a stationary phase (often a solid) and a mobile phase (often a liquid). The separation is achieved by partitioning between the phases, but it does not primarily involve the solubility of the compounds in two different immiscible solvents.</li>\n</ul>"

In staggered conformation, the dihedral angle, or the angle between the planes containing the hydrogen atoms, is actually $$60^{\\circ}$$. However, the staggered form is not unique; it refers to the form where any given pair of hydrogens on adjacent carbons has this dihedral angle, but rotating the molecule can yield a variety of staggered conformations with different specific hydrogen atoms at the $$60^{\\circ}$$ dihedral angle. The full rotation of one ethyl group relative to the other through $$360^{\\circ}$$ creates a cycle where the staggered conformation occurs every $$120^{\\circ}$$.</p>\n\n<p>Option B: \"Ethane has infinite number of conformations.\"\nThis statement is correct. The rotation around the carbon-carbon single bond (sigma bond) is relatively free, so ethane can theoretically adopt an infinite number of conformations between the two extremes of staggered and eclipsed. These conformations can have very slight differences in angles, resulting in finely varied overlap of electron clouds.</p>\n\n<p>Option C: \"Eclipsed conformation is the most stable conformation.\"\nThis statement is incorrect, which makes it the answer to the question. The eclipsed conformation is actually the least stable conformation of ethane due to the increased torsional strain from electron repulsion. The electron clouds of the bonding pairs of hydrogens on adjacent carbons are aligned in such a way as to be as close to each other as possible, increasing repulsion. The most stable conformation is the staggered conformation, where the groups are as far apart as possible, reducing repulsion.</p>\n\n<p>Option D: \"The conformations of ethane are inter-convertible to one-another.\"\nThis statement is correct. As you rotate around the carbon-carbon single bond, the conformations continuously change from one to another. This interconversion can be quite rapid and occurs without the need for a high energy input under normal conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the incorrect statement is Option C.</p>"

However, it is not typically dependent on the physical state of the pure compound. Here&#39;s why :</p>\n<p>Option A : The solubility of the compound in the mobile phase and its interaction with the stationary phase are key factors in determining how the compound will migrate in a chromatographic system. Hence, the solubility of the compound does affect its purification.</p>\n<p>Option B : The mobility or flow of the solvent system, often referred to as the mobile phase in chromatography, also plays a significant role in the separation of components in the mixture. The rate at which the mobile phase moves can influence how far and how quickly the components of the mixture will travel.</p>\n<p>Option C : The physical state (solid, liquid, gas) of the pure compound is usually not a factor in the purification process in chromatography. Whether a compound is solid, liquid, or gas does not typically affect its ability to be separated by chromatography, as it is the interactions between the compound and the stationary/mobile phases that are key.</p>\n<p>Option D : The length of the column or TLC plate can impact the degree of separation achieved in chromatography. A longer column or TLC plate can provide more opportunities for the interactions that drive the separation process, often leading to better separation of the components.</p>\n<p>So, Option C is correct : The physical state of the pure compound is usually not a factor in its purification by chromatography.</p>"
