This test specifically distinguishes these reducing sugars from non-reducing sugars and is often used to identify the presence of an aldehyde functional group. </p>\n\n<p>Let's analyze each option:</p>\n\n<p>A. Formic acid - Formic acid ($HCOOH$) is a carboxylic acid but importantly, it can also reduce silver ions to metallic silver because it can act as a reducing agent just like aldehydes. Thus, it will give a positive Tollen's test. </p>\n\n<p>B. Formaldehyde ($HCHO$) is the simplest aldehyde, and aldehydes are known to give positive results with the Tollen's test since they can be oxidized to carboxylic acids, reducing the silver ions in the process to metallic silver.</p>\n\n<p>C. Benzaldehyde ($C_6H_5CHO$) is an aromatic aldehyde and, similar to formaldehyde, it can be oxidized to an acid, thereby reducing the silver ions to silver in the Tollen's test, giving a positive result.</p>\n\n<p>D. Acetone ($CH_3COCH_3$) is a ketone. Generally, ketones do not undergo oxidation easily and do not reduce ammoniacal silver nitrate, and thus, do not give a silver mirror with the Tollen's reagent.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the compounds that will give a silver mirror with ammoniacal silver nitrate (positive Tollen's test) are Formic acid, Formaldehyde, and Benzaldehyde, but not Acetone.</p>\n\n<p>The correct answer from the options given is therefore:</p>\n\n<p>Option C: A, B, and C only.</p>"

The presence of acidic $$\\alpha$$-hydrogens in aldehydes and ketones makes it possible for these compounds to undergo deprotonation, forming enolates.

Benzaldehyde (which lacks an $$\\alpha$$-hydrogen) can indeed react with ethanal (which has an $$\\alpha$$-hydrogen) in a Cross-Aldol reaction.

Hydrogen bonding is the strongest intermolecular force among the forces affecting these molecules. Therefore, butanol will have the highest boiling point among the compounds without considering the others.</p>\n\n<p>Option B: Butane only has van der Waals forces because it is a non-polar molecule. Van der Waals forces are the weakest intermolecular forces, resulting in a lower boiling point compared to molecules that can hydrogen bond or have permanent dipoles.</p>\n\n<p>Option C: Butyraldehyde can form dipole-dipole interactions because of its polar carbonyl ($\\mathrm{C=O}$) group, but it cannot form hydrogen bonds with itself since there is no $\\mathrm{OH}$ group. Dipole-dipole interactions are stronger than van der Waals forces but weaker than hydrogen bonds. As a result, butyraldehyde will have a higher boiling point than butane but a lower boiling point than butanol.</p>\n\n<p>Option D: Diethyl ether has an oxygen atom, which makes it polar and enables dipole-dipole interactions. However, ethers cannot form hydrogen bonds with themselves, so diethyl ether will have a higher boiling point than butane but lower than butanol.</p>\n\n<p>Considering the intermolecular forces, the compound with the highest boiling point is the one that can form hydrogen bonds, which in this list is the primary alcohol, butanol.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the compound with the highest boiling point is:</p>\n<p>Option A : Butanol ($\\mathrm{CH}_3 \\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{CH}_2-\\mathrm{OH}$).</p>"
